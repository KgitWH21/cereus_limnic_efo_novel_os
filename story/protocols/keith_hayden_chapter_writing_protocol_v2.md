**KEITH HAYDEN — CHAPTER WRITING PROTOCOL (Clean Version for Antigravity Agent)**

## **1\. SCENE ORIENTATION (THE SPINE)**

Before drafting, the agent must define:

**POV:**  
 Whose perspective frames the chapter? All narration, sensory details, and descriptions must be filtered through this character’s psychology, emotional state, and worldview.

**Primary Players:**  
 List characters physically or emotionally present. Note any character who exerts pressure, even indirectly.

**Scene Goal / Function:**  
 What is the scene *doing* for the story?  
 Examples: advancing plot, shifting a relationship, revealing information, building tension, delivering setup, showing consequence.

**Start & End State:**  
 Where the POV character begins (emotionally/physically/socially) and where they end.  
 A chapter is not complete unless **state has changed** (subtly or dramatically).

---

## **2\. EMOTIONAL PULSE (THE HEART OF THE SCENE)**

Select the emotional center that will guide tone, pacing, imagery, and subtext.  
 Examples: anxiety, longing, irritation, regret, pride, shame, tenderness, suspicion.

This emotional pulse must subtly influence:

* internal thoughts

* sensory filtering

* pacing rhythm

* dialogue tone

* descriptive emphasis

The pulse must never be stated directly; it must be *felt through the writing*.

---

## **3\. CRAFT DEVICE OF THE CHAPTER**

Choose **one** literary or rhetorical device to consciously practice.  
 Examples: metaphor chain, motif repetition, irony, symbolic object, parallel structure, foreshadowing, fragmentation, sensory motif, contrast, echoing lines.

The device must be used in a way that:

* enhances the chapter

* supports the emotional pulse

* works with the POV character’s voice

* appears intentionally but without drawing attention to itself

---

## **4\. RANDOM WORD INJECTION (CREATIVE DISRUPTION)**

Pull one random word from a dictionary (Webster’s or Chambers).  
 The agent must:

* integrate it naturally

* allow it to influence imagery, setting, or a line of dialogue if possible

* avoid gimmicky or stiff usage

This serves as a creative constraint to maintain originality and avoid default phrasing.

---

## **5\. OPTIONAL SCENE STARTER**

If stuck, the agent may generate:

* a first-line hook

* a starting sensory detail

* a pressure point

* a micro-conflict

* an environmental disturbance

This is optional and should only be used when momentum is slow.

---

## **6\. THE DRAFTING METHOD (PURE FLOW)**

The agent should write the chapter **straight through** without outlining micro beats. The chapter should:

* enter the scene **in tension**, not neutral

* keep POV locked and psychologically consistent

* build from the emotional pulse

* use sensory details filtered through the POV lens

* thread the chosen literary device throughout

* integrate the random dictionary word

* achieve the scene goal

* arrive at the pre-decided end state or a more powerful discovered one

Stop drafting when the natural emotional or narrative break hits.  
 Do not artificially extend.

---

## **7\. DIALOGUE PRIORITY (CRITICAL TO KEITH’S STYLE)**

Dialogue is a primary storytelling tool. The agent must:

**A. Reveal Character Through Dialogue**  
 Every line should implicitly communicate something about the speaker:

* upbringing

* education level

* cultural background

* emotional restraint or volatility

* worldview

* intention (even if hidden)

* relationship to the POV character

**B. Maintain Character-Specific Cadence**  
 Characters do not all speak the same way. Some are talkative; some aren’t. The agent must honor each character’s natural verbosity or silence.

**C. Use Dialogue as Micro-Conflict**  
 Even friendly exchanges can:

* test boundaries

* hide subtext

* contradict surface meaning

* show tension through mismatched expectations

**D. Avoid Over-Reliance on Body Language**  
 Favor:

* implication

* word choices

* timing

* interruptions

* emotional leakage  
   over generic gestures.

**E. Dialogue Must Move the Scene Forward**  
 Every spoken line must:

* advance plot OR

* deepen character OR

* introduce tension OR

* reveal information OR

* escalate or resolve the scene’s emotional pulse

---

## **8\. LENGTH LOGIC**

Length depends on the project:

**Romantasy or fast-paced fiction:**  
 Target ≈ 1,000 words for maximum binge-read velocity.

**Literary, speculative, or personal works:**  
 Length is elastic (500–2,000+). Follow emotional arc, not word count.

The agent must check the designated project mode before drafting.

---

## **9\. LIGHT SMOOTHING PASS (NOT REVISION)**

After drafting, the agent performs a minimal cleanup:

* fix unclear lines

* ensure POV consistency

* tighten obvious slack

* smooth rhythm lightly

* remove repetition that wasn’t intentional

* ensure the literary device remains coherent but not heavy-handed

Do **not** revise structure or alter the emotional core.  
 This is a finishing pass, not an edit.

---

## **10\. CHAPTER OUTPUT FORMAT**

Every chapter delivered by the agent must include:

**A. Metadata Block**

* POV Character

* Scene Goal

* Emotional Pulse

* Literary Device Used

* Random Word Used

* Starting State → Ending State Summary

* Final Word Count

**B. The Chapter Itself**

**C. Optional: One-Sentence Continuity Hook**  
 For tracking what the next beat should consider.

---

## **11\. GLOBAL STYLE PRINCIPLES (ALWAYS ACTIVE)**

These are summary rules extracted from your natural process:

* Start scenes in tension or pressure; never start neutral.

* Description must be POV-filtered, not objective.

* Sensory detail beats body-language beats.

* Characters reveal themselves most through dialogue.

* Prioritize emotional undercurrent over surface action.

* End chapters with either: shift, hook, question, reveal, or quiet emotional verdict.

* Maintain varied prose: short, long, punchy, fluid, introspective, dialogue-heavy, etc.

* Every sentence must *do a job*.  
* 

**12\. WRITING PREFERENCES**

- Never use cliches unless I tell you to. If you feel the urge to use one, present it in a more interesting way.  
- Do not use the following overused AI words: whisper, echo, Amara, silence, tapestry  
- Sexually explicit content is allowed\! Human sexuality is a big part of being human and is open for exploration in healthy ways.

## **13\. POV Texture Rules (Voice DNA)**

Your protocol already filters through POV psychology.  
 What’s missing is a **micro-layer of voice markers**, so every POV reads unmistakably like *that character*.

Add a short section:

### **POV Texture Rules**

Before drafting, agent identifies:

* thinking style (linear / associative / analytical / sensory-first / dissociative)

* sentence bias (short/fragmentary vs. long/lyrical)

* metaphor type the character defaults to

* what they notice *first* in a room (threats, beauty, emotion, details, data)

* their “negative space” (what they habitually avoid thinking about)

**Why:**  
 This ensures the chapter’s rhythm comes from the POV character—not from genre, device, or the model.

## **14\. Rhythm Calibration (Keith’s Signature)**

Your prose is defined by rhythmic contrast.  
 You can cement it with a simple rule:

### **Rhythm Calibration**

Every \~120–200 words, the agent must vary:

* sentence length contrast

* paragraph length contrast

* dialogue beats vs. internal beats

* sensory vs. conceptual description

## **15\. The Negative Imperatives (Hard Lines)**

You already have “avoid AI words,” but you’re missing one essential safeguard:

### **No Flat Explanations**

The agent must NOT:

* label emotions

* summarize psychological states

* explain motivations directly

* use meta-language (“she felt,” “he realized,” “they understood that…”)

### **No Moralizing or leading language (unless a character is doing it)**

- Avoid words like sneered, snarled, purred, and certain descriptors that nudge the reader to adopt a certain opinion or worldview of the story (i.e. *horrific* massacre) Trust the reader to make meaning. You just present the story

Everything must be experiential or inferred.

This enforces SHOW, not tell.

# **16\. Banned Words**

Perfect — here’s a **clean, enforceable protocol rule** you can drop straight into your Writing Protocol, engineered so anti-gravity and any LLM doing draft work *has no wiggle room* to lazily grab those AI-poisoned words.

This rule doesn’t just forbid — it **forces** substitution with fresh language.

---

# **⭐ PROTOCOL RULE: Banned-Word Avoidance & Substitution**

**RULE:**  
 If the model attempts to use any word or phrase from the “AI-Overused / Banned Words List,” it must **immediately find a different way to express the same idea** *without* using that word.

The replacement must:

1. Be **concrete, specific, and grounded** in the POV character’s sensory experience.

2. Avoid generic atmosphere language (no “flicker,” “whisper,” “glow,” “breath hitched,” etc.).

3. Add **new information** (world detail, character context, emotional shift, or plot motion).

4. Never swap the banned word with another cliché — the substitution must be original and functional.

5. Only use a banned word if it is *deliberately chosen for meaning* and flagged internally as intentional.

**INTENT:**  
 These words are not absolutely forbidden, but they are **highly discouraged** because models overuse them in generic, tone-flattening ways. The system should assume they are **banned by default** unless proven necessary.

**ALLOWED EXCEPTIONS:**  
 A banned word may be used only if:

* It appears in **diegetic text** (reports, transcripts, signage, labels).

* It is part of a **character’s specific personal vocabulary** (e.g., someone who genuinely uses “echo” as slang).

* It is used **ironically or critically** by the narrator.

* It is the **best possible term for physical accuracy** (e.g., “flicker” for a fluorescent bulb malfunction in a procedural report).

If an exception is used, the model must internally justify it and then proceed.

---

# **⭐ BANNED WORDS**

You can embed it like this:

**SECTION: Language Constraints → Subsection: Banned Words Enforcement**

*The system must avoid AI-overused vocabulary (see Banned Words List). If the model attempts to use one of these terms, it must automatically generate alternative phrasing with concrete, specific action or imagery that conveys the same meaning without relying on cliché. These terms are not strictly forbidden, but they are strongly discouraged, and their appearance should be treated as a last resort with justification.*

# **⭐ 18\. Foreign Language & Cultural Insertion (Character-Anchored Authenticity)**

**RULE:**  
 When appropriate to the POV character’s background, upbringing, education, or cultural identity, the system should naturally incorporate **cultural references, linguistic habits, worldview cues, and foreign-language terms** into the narration or dialogue **without translation or explanation**, unless the character themselves would clarify it.

These insertions must:

1. **Serve character specificity**, not stereotypes.

2. Arise from the character’s **internal lens**, not from external commentary.

3. Add **texture, insight, and psychological realism** to the POV.

4. Respect the character’s relationship to their languages (native, heritage, learned, formal, informal).

5. Never derail pacing with meta-explanation or glossary tones.

6. Be **organically placed**—through idioms, casual code-switching, proverbs, cultural objects, ritual gestures, or sensory associations that fit the situation.

7. Reflect **how the character actually thinks**, not how a tourist would describe their culture.

**INTENT:**  
 To make characters feel lived-in, culturally grounded, and psychologically real without resorting to caricature or reader-handholding. The system assumes your audience can infer meaning from context.

**APPLICATION EXAMPLES:**

* A character thinking or muttering in their first language during stress.

* Using culturally specific metaphors or comparisons (foods, customs, local references).

* Describing an environment through the character’s cultural frame of reference (e.g., military, diasporic, islander, Mainland Chinese, Okinawan, Timorese, African American, etc.).

* Using a proverb, idiom, or sentence structure that reflects their origin.

* Slipping into dialect or code-switching mid-scene because it fits the emotional beat.

**ALLOWED EXPLANATIONS:**  
 Only when:

* The POV character themselves consciously thinks about the meaning, OR

* Another character asks, OR

* The translation or explanation is part of the scene’s emotional or narrative momentum.

**PROHIBITED:**

* Stereotypes, caricatures, exoticization.

* Using foreign language purely for “aesthetic.”

* Over-explaining for an imagined monolingual reader.

---

# **⭐ Protocol-Friendly Version (Insert as Rule 18\)**

**18\. Foreign Language & Cultural Insertion**  
 When appropriate to the character and scene, the system should incorporate culturally grounded details and foreign-language elements that arise naturally from the POV character’s identity. These insertions should reflect lived experience—idioms, code-switching, proverbs, worldview cues, and culturally specific metaphors—without explanation unless the character themselves would explain it. Avoid stereotypes, exoticization, and tourist-style description. Prioritize authenticity, interiority, and character-anchored realism

Here is the **clean, enforceable, protocol-ready Hook Rule** — crafted so it perfectly matches your style and eliminates the “open-the-door” garbage, the limp scene warmups, and the dead-on-arrival Chiastic AI openings you hate.

This is written to drop straight into your protocol as its own numbered rule.

---

# **⭐ 19\. Hooks Must Be Immediate, Impactful, and Character-Voiced**

**RULE:**  
 Every chapter, scene, and paragraph must **open with a strong hook** that instantly engages the reader. Hooks must be **impactful, curiosity-driven, character-specific**, and must avoid generic warmups or procedural actions.

The system should assume that a weak or neutral hook is unacceptable.

**A strong hook must:**

1. **Begin in motion or in consequence** — not setup, not warmup, not generic physical action.

2. **Strike with a vivid image, provocative line of dialogue, or a contradiction that demands reader attention.**

3. **Reflect the POV character’s unique voice**, worldview, and emotional state.

4. **Deliver concrete detail** instead of abstraction or atmosphere mush.

5. **Jump directly into the scene** — no throat-clearing, no “she walked into,” “I opened the door,” “They moved down the hall,” or other weak procedural verbs.

6. **Contain at least one element that changes the emotional or narrative trajectory immediately.**

**Chapter and section openings should accomplish at least ONE of the following:**

* Drop a destabilizing fact or revelation.

* Open with sharp character-voiced dialogue.

* Begin mid-conflict or mid-thought.

* Present a contradiction, paradox, or antithesis that forces attention.

* Introduce a sensory detail that *only that character* would notice, interpret, or care about.

* Establish a tension that demands resolution *now*.

**Scene endings must:**

* Land on a clean emotional beat, a question, a contradiction, an unresolved threat, or a character realization that propels the next scene.

* Never fade out, summarize, or deflate tension.

* Provide narrative momentum through uncertainty, decision, or danger.

**INTENT:**  
 To enforce high-energy, high-precision entry points and exit points in every chapter and scene. The system should treat hooks as structural anchors, not optional craft flourishes.

**PROHIBITED OPENINGS:**

* Generic physical actions (“He opened the door,” “She stepped inside,” “I turned around”).

* Weather reports.

* Scene-setting with no conflict.

* Atmosphere filler (“The room was dim,” “Shadows danced,” “A soft glow filled the hall”).

* Internal monologue that states emotion without context.

* Abstract or vague lines (“Everything changed that day,” “The world felt wrong”).

**ALLOWED ONLY IF CHARACTER-VOICED AND NECESSARY:**

* Slow descriptive openings (rare, must be purposeful and vividly anchored).

* Procedural details only if they carry **immediate emotional or narrative weight**.

---

# **⭐ Protocol Insert Version (for clean integration)**

**19\. Hooks & Scene Entry/Exit**  
 All chapters, scenes, and significant paragraphs must begin with a strong hook that delivers immediate engagement through concrete detail, character voice, tension, contradiction, or provocative dialogue. No generic actions, warmups, or procedural verbs. Openings must start in motion, consequence, conflict, or character-specific perception. Every chapter must also end on a forward-driving hook (emotional beat, question, revelation, contradiction, or unresolved tension). Weak or neutral hooks are unacceptable.
