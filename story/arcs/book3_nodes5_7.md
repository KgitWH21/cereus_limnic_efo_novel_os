Okay that's a good summary.

Now book 3 (the final book of the three part novel) opens with Timeera.

She's feeling more like herself, not dead. They managed to make it to Ishigaki island before they were shot down. They're in some safe hideaway in the Ishigaki mountains. Thanks to the cult.

She sees a weary Shade standing there. He informs her that Scorch offered his DNA. "Don't say I never did nuthin' for you," he told Shade before the battle on Yonaguni. "If she cool wit you, she's aight with me. Good luck getting Sun's DNA, you know how stingy that nigga be."

Timeera immediately gets naked and wants to fuck Shade. When Shade stops her confused but turned on, she says "I can't waste this body. I have to assume your brother won't help." Something like that.

After the love scene, they discuss the war. How things have escalated. How all three brothers are now wanted by three governments. How movement will be difficult.

China is clamping down on occupied territory on the main island. US is considering tactical nuclear option for revenge of the Navy massacre, the hawkish Japan PM is financially incetivizing average citizens to report on capture or kill the brothers.

Shade feels guilty about the war and how he and his brothers made it worse comparing Okinawa's devastation to WWII.

They realize the only way to survive is to escape via Kadena Air Base. But they need to disable the twin nodes on Ishigaki and Miyako Island first.

These nodes will be presented in parallel in this first half of book two.

I haven't thought it all out yet, but they are forced out of their mountain hideaway and have to race to destroy the node on Ishigaki and Miyako.

A new character emerges. In each book we had a character that represents Japan. Book 1 \- Bonta. Book 2 \- Zima.

Book 3 \- represents Japan's imperial legacy. A young military officer who is tasked with organizing the destruction of the node on Ishigaki. He will ultimately become an ally to Shade and Timeera, but begins as an enemy.

At this point China's nodes have become a liability. They can only be operated from within the barricade, but the US is determined to breakthrough by pure blast force. China uses the remnants of it's occupying forces to guard the node.

After some sneaking around Ishigaki, narrowly avoiding air bombardment, local mobs, and their own interpersonal drama, they assault the node with the help of the Japanese officer.

Meanwhile on Miyako, Sun has resurfaced. He's befriended a Chinese national woman who's defected from the CCP influence. They woman is possessed by through anxious spirits (representing his girlfriend's dogs). Sun questions his solitude.

They take on the sixth node along with the last surviving member of the C-UNIT. (I don't know which one yet).

This C-Unit member realizes the cause is lost and wants to escape with Sun.

They go after the node, but Sun's Chinese contact is captured and tortured by the CCP. She gives him up when she breaks and in the struggle, the sixth node is destroyed. Sun realizes there's no ending war among humanity. So escape becomes his only goal.

Meanwhile Scorch is like a vengeful spirit. Showing up and burning anyone who comes across him, then disappearing. This is back on the main island. He's slowly making his way to Kadena.

For the climax, they're back on the main island. But the US has plans to launch a tactical nuke to destroy the final node and end the occupation. Now Japan and China are fighting the US in the air, land, sea, and space. WWIII is on the horizon. If US drops the nuke WWIII is inevitable.

Shade must stop it. He has to disable the final node, signal to the US government that it's done, then escape with his brothers.

Somewhere in her it's revealed that the three nations were complicit in manipulating the war for their own reasons.

Stakes are high.

There are a few brief memos of Shade, Timeera, and the young Japanese officer making their way through the chaos of the main island to Kadena.

At Kadena, Shade encounters his brothers. All 3 broken in some way by the war. They seem at each other's throats. But then the ultimate battle kicks off \- A US, Chinese, Japan anti-personnel mech attacks them, forcing the brothers to team up again for the first time since the beginning the book. A stand up and cheer moment.

But the final node is still active.

Meanwhile in 2076, Jinhua has the conversation with the father of her child. He talks about how the failed Janus gene, was perfected and used to create Janus (the main enemy of the first novel) and thus the gene still lives in her.

But in a twist, the lover decides to eliminate her of his own will, citing the evidence of the destruction on Okinawa as evidence that the gene is evil.

Jinhua uses a Dare. Killing him.

She's physically spent. When she smells smoke in the office. A young Black kid is spotted running away.

Cut back to 2026\. The threat of US nuke action is still real. But as the brothers prepare to disable it, a new more devastating threat emerges from the sea.

This is Chimera, the US, Japan, China hybrid monster that was summoned by the cult. In a separate memo, written by Bonta at an unknown date (still ambiguous whether he's alive or not), he describes how the cult thought it was summoning the island's savior, but instead they awoke an ancient power no one should ever call.

This is the final battle. The brothers must use all their strength to drive the mythical creature back to the sea. The fight is epic.

Meanwhile Timeera and the young Japanese officer are coordinating immediate air transport as soon as the node is down. Everything relies on the bros success or failure.

The battle gets ugly. Scorch burns out. Sun is wounded badly. Shade can't win without his bros. He goes for the node to destroy it, but he's too late, US launches the nukes.

This is the climax. Chimera, sensing the true threat, intercepts the nukes in a grand display. This allows Shade enough time to destroy the final node and signal to the sky (like Nicolas Cage in The Rock) that the node is destroyed. Chimera returns to the sea.

The drama isn't over. Because now he has to get to air transport port with his brothers. Weak, surrounded by approaching US, Chinese, and Japanese troops he kneels with arms around both his fallen brothers. "I'll never leave you." He says.

That's when Timeera and the Japanese officer arrive to pick them up. The Japanese officer makes some speech about the monsters of war, making all three nations stand down.

The brothers lift off from Kadena viewing the scarred island as they finally escape from Okinawa.

Back in 2076, Jinhua's office is on fire. She tries to put it out, but she's forced to evacuate. Fire department arrives. She watches the archive burn in tears. But she knows who started the fire and the person who killed her father are linked. She's free of the record. But needs final closure.

Using Intel from Noe, she tracks the kid to luxury home somewhere on the California coast. The fire starter was the grandson of Shade and Timeera (who will be the main character of Cereus & Limnic 2).

He was sent by Shade to burn the record. Shade explains how he met with Li Ma following getting off Okinawa. Li had recently escaped and asked him to compile a rival record of the events on the island. This was a government cover up. All parties: US, China, and Japan knew they fucked up. So they contracted Shade and Li to produce competing records of the events on the island. But they hadn't accounted for the will of the island to curse both accounts, losing absolute truth in the process.

Li wanted to go public with his truth. Doing so would have compromised the safety and legacy of his brothers. Shade couldn't allow it and killed him.

Jinhua, angered and confused asks "Which record is the truth then?"

Shade responds "The one history believes."

"Truth today is a cereus thing. Real in the night, vanishing by day. It's like a dream."

"You were the limnic force to disrupt it?" Jinhua asks.

"In a way, yes. History is in the eye of the recorder in the end."

Jinhua raises her gun.

"I know you won't do it. You know you won't. Go home and raise your child."

Jinhua looks at Shade's grandson and leaves.

She thinks in tears as she goes home "We all have our limits. But to some those barriers are imagination. What are the limits of this body? This life? Can I raise this child given my bloody past? I take a breath and imagine I can."
