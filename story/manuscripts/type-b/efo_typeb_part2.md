# To Iheya \- Shade POV

You can’t drink spilled water. But it just spreads, saturates, the entire surface where it’s toppled over. Meanwhile, you sit there, endless ocean tempting, crashing, waving— thirsty as hell, with the understanding that even with the abundant image of the stuff, you’re dead if you surrender to the illusion and drink. I’m thinking of that now, as I write this. Waiting for a PLA patrol to fuck—

Up she comes from the jungle. Timeera does this slinking thing. With the patrols knocked out, stars running rings around their (hopefully) unconscious forms, I saw and sensed, her heat before she emerged once again from the bushy Okinawa brush. Glassigs thermal mode outlined her body in red, orange, and blue blobs. If I viewed this hot circles longer, I’d lose focus on the very necessary polestar of preparing the small vessel for Iheya.  
---

**To Iheya \- Shade POV (Continued)**

I kill the thermal overlay before she reaches the shoreline. Don't need the reminder of heat signatures right now.

"Glassigs? See anything… interesting?" Timeera asks as she rests a hand on her hip. She's already scanning the unconscious patrols, cataloging angles and escape routes the way she always does. The way *we* all do. 

“I… suppose all I saw was the moon.”

She made a fast nod. I almost saw a grin. Thought I did.

“This all you?”

“Yeah, not much time before they get up.” I don't turn from the vessel. Fingers busy with mooring lines—the kind of work that looks purposeful, keeps hands occupied while the rest of you decides what to feel. "You're a long way from wherever you're supposed to be."

She moves closer. Not threatening. Not comforting either. Just Timeera: a woman whose body is slowly eating itself from the inside, dressed in borrowed urgency.

"Command redirected me." She settles against the hull, careful not to rock it. Careful like everything costs her now, which it does. "Said you'd be here. Said you'd want a ride to Iheya."

*Command*. That means PLA brass, which means this wasn't improvisation. This was planned while I was still sorting through the remains of—

I don't finish that thought.

"What happened at the Node?" I ask instead.

Timeera's quiet for three breaths. Long enough that I know it's bad. Long enough that she's deciding what truth to serve first.

"Your brother happened," she finally says. "Scorch. The fire spread faster than containment protocols could manage. Node 2 is gone, Shade. Completely compromised. The structure failed from the inside out."

There it is. The confirmation. Not suspicion—*fact*. One of the seven nodes sealing Okinawa, cracked open like an egg. Like a wound that won't close.

"PLA response?"

"Mobilizing. Everyone's mobilizing." Timeera shifts, winces. Her medication's wearing thin. I can hear it in her breathing. "Both sides think if the nodes fall, the containment fails. If containment fails..." She doesn't finish. We both know the math. Catastrophic escalation. Full occupation collapse into open war. "Command's terrified. The Chinese are terrified. Even the local resistance is running scared because scared people make mistakes."

The water spreads. Saturates. Drowns everything.

"Why are you really here?" The question comes out quieter than I intended.

She meets my eyes. There's calculation in that look, but there's something else too—something that feels like admission. "Partial truth: they need to know your status. Full truth: I need intel on your brothers. On *you*. Blood patterns, genetic markers, whatever makes you three what you are." A pause. Then, harder: "Because there might be someone I can use it to save."

Chrysalis. She doesn't say the name. Doesn't need to.

"Your extraction mission." Not a question.

"My extraction mission," she confirms. "But also... my friend's last known location was near Node 2 when things went sideways. Chrysalis was running operations in that sector. If she's still alive, if I can access what makes you functional at the genetic level, maybe I can trade that information up the chain, get resources to find her before she becomes one more casualty this war sweeps under."

There's honesty in that. The particular honesty of operatives who've learned that lying to each other wastes time neither of you has.

"So you're using me to save her, and using her location to justify extracting from me." I step into the vessel, testing the weight distribution. "And I'm supposed to let you because...?"

"Because I'm good at not dying." Timeera stands, moves to the boat. There's that electrical charge between us—the kind that happens when two people understand each other's calculus and find it acceptable. "And you need someone who knows the Iheya protocols. Someone PLA-cleared who can move without triggering every alarm between here and there."

"And if I say no?"

"Then you paddle out alone, and I file a report saying you evaded extraction. Command doesn't take that kindly." She smiles, thin and sharp. "But we both know you won't say no. Because you need answers too. Because Sun's hunting Scorch, and Scorch is hunting something, and you're in the middle trying to keep them from burning the whole island down. And you can't do that alone."

She's not wrong. Sun's promise echoes: *If I see him again, I'll kill him.* Scorch, unmoored and raging. And me, trying to find them both before they drag the entire occupation into full collapse.

I offer her a hand into the boat. She takes it. Warm skin over cooling augmentations, both of us running hot and cold simultaneously.

"Iheya's compromised now," I say as she settles across from me. "Node 2 going down changes everything. If they trace you helping me—"

"Then we move faster than they can trace." She pulls a data chip from her pocket, hands it over. "Node 2 surveillance feeds. Last four hours before cascade failure. You need to see what Scorch did. What he's *becoming*."

I pocket it without looking. I don't need to look. I already know what I'll find: proof that my brother is becoming something neither of us can stop.

The motor ignites. We pull away from Tokashiki, ocean spreading beneath us—endless, drowning, tempting.

Behind us, the patrols are starting to stir. Above us, the first surveillance drones are picking up heat signatures, running calculations.

The Tower stands waiting.

"Tell me about Chrysalis," I say, pointing the bow toward open water. "Tell me everything."

Timeera begins to talk, and I listen while the island shrinks behind us, another piece of the game board revealed, another player moved into position, another node in a dying network counting down to collapse.

# Archivist’s Note

So they went to Iheya, but they couldn’t have known about the hive. That writhing swarm, crawling with interleukin energy? Not even an afterthought. Though it seems the two of them— Shade and Timeera— grew fond of each other, I still don’t understand her motive and how it connects to the bigger picture. What is clear is that she wanted, *needed*, to play nice with the brothers. She’s good. I’ll keep reading tomorrow to find out more.

Reluctantly, I’m at home tonight. Another microwave meal of rice and veggies is what I had. I went online to watch a few videos, but nothing stuck, it was just background noise so I shut it off.

The case follows me like a spirit, shadowing every step. I wonder if Dr. Zelda had any idea her creation would contribute to that dark conflict. From the documents, she surely did.

I weighed myself, took vitamins, considered self-pleasure, decided against it, took a shower, got dressed to attempt sleep, then climbed into bed—

BANG\! BANG\! BANG\!

The sound of a heavy fist on the door sent my heart into overdrive. 

BANG\! BANG\!

I stare at the bedroom’s doorway, hoping it will go away.

BANG\!

I get out of bed, and go for the Sig at the back of my bra drawer. A sleek P365, Noe had given it to me as a gift after my semi-celebrity status had gotten out of hand a decade ago. Fame comes with phantoms in human form. The desperate and obsessed, stalkers and jealous: after you’ve seen so many, protection becomes mandatory.

BANG\! BANG\!

She’d taken me a few times to fire it, but it was still a jolting surprise when it discharged. My hands were never steady enough to aim right.

Now it was in my hand, quivering, as I stood at the door.

“Who is it\!?” I called out in my most urgent voice, but it still sounded too soft to be a threat. 

No response. I waited three more breaths and viewed through the peephole. Nobody was there.

I raised the weapon and psyched myself up to open the door and even shoot if I had to.

Open the door. RIP\!

I scanned left, right, maintaining as much tactical presence as possible at the late hour. The hallway was clear. Only the clean sting of the living tower’s fragrance lifted into my nose, which caused me to sneeze.

But there was one thing there. At my feet, a small bottle of Peachtree schnapps sat there. I nearly bent over to pick it up, but recalled Noe’s advice for keeping my sight “downrange” when a threat might be present, so I carefully endured knee pops to grab the bottle’s neck, watch the hall, then back into my apartment. When the door was secure, my heart went from bounding to beating normally again.

A small note was attached to the bottle’s back:

“Fruits time out. Your father’s monster.”

I spent the rest of the night thinking about its meaning.

# Bonta finds a cult

Oh woe is me\! I am abandoned. Lost in a known island\! I’ve spent the last several days scrounging and sneaking— no way for a young man to live (is what one of the elders said).

Timeera took off one night. I had thought she went to relieve herself, but by daybreak she was a flower-scent in the wind. She did leave me some money and half a ration.

Why did she leave without a word? Perhaps because I am a burden. Unable to fend or defend myself with no skills but fishing and some stealth to survive this war. Oh cruel goodness\! I am FIG’d (forgotten in guidance).

Now I must strikeout 一人で no one else can help me track down my forsaken sister Meio in this devastating conflict that that once again, is taking its toll on common folk more than folklore ever had influence.

For a day or two, I roamed the remnants of Zamami like a zombie, sweating and thirsty with its ragged inhabitants. Tears flooded me for a third time that day as desperation tore at my nerves like hungry wolf.

That’s when I met *her*.

She sat on the cement dock among the giant tetrapods with her legs dangling, silver eyes fixed on the horizon like she was reading text written on the water. Her hair—multicolored, long—caught the late sun. But what struck me first was her figure. She was tall, broad through the shoulders and stocky—a woman of considerable assets, as one might say. Yet she held herself with such perfect composure that the word "large" felt wrong. She was just... substantial. Dignified. Undeniable.

I would have kept moving, but she turned and looked at me.

"You're searching for someone," she said.

I stopped. "How would you—"

"Because you have the look," she continued, studying me with clinical precision. "The ones searching are easy to read. What is it you're looking for?"

I should have lied. Instead: "My sister. I think she's nearby."

"Deliberately separated? Or by circumstance?"

The question was so *exact* it felt like she'd reached into my skull.

"Does it matter?" I asked.

"Yes. One involves betrayal. One involves accepting a pattern you don't yet understand."

I felt something shift. How was she doing this?

"What's your name?"

"Ōkari. And yours?"

"Bonta."

She nodded as if confirming something. "When you dream about your sister, what does she tell you?"

I stepped back. She couldn't possibly know that I dream about Meio constantly—that the words always dissolve before I can understand them.

"Come. Sit," she said, extending a hand. "You look like you haven't had a real conversation in months."

And I did. I sat on that breakwater and told her everything. About Meio, about Timeera leaving, about feeling like a burden. Each question she asked felt surgical, precise—like she was moving levers inside my mind.

As the sun dropped lower, she turned back to the water. Her eyes tracked something I couldn't see. For a moment, I thought I caught it too—a shadow beneath the surface, darker than the surrounding blue. A shape. A *presence*. But when I blinked, it was gone. Probably a shark. Probably nothing.

"The water knows," she said quietly. "The earth knows. It knows what you're searching for, Bonta. It's been watching the separated ones."

"What are you talking about?" I asked, but my voice came out thin.

She didn't answer. Just kept watching the horizon with that unsettling stillness.

"Have you considered that your sister might be trying to reach you?" she continued, as if she hadn't said anything strange. "That there are communities—circles—of people who understand loss? People who look for those who are searching?"

"Circles?" I repeated.

"People who understand what islands like Iheya really are," she said, and smiled in a way that wasn't warm. "I think I can help you find her. But first, there are people I'd like you to meet. People who listen to what the water tells them."

I followed her into the darkening village. And I couldn't shake the feeling that something supernatural had just occurred—that this tall woman with her considerable frame and silver eyes had read something in me that no one else could see.

Only now do I wonder: *Was she reading me, or awakening something already there? And what was moving in that water?*

# Arrival on Iheya

Although the Iheya air is stagnant and tainted with choking humidity, the sea shimmers. Morning light gave it that classic anime glitter. I wanted more time to appreciate it, but Timeera’s ornery mood killed the vibe.

She mimicked a sad viola song with her fingers. “We’re not here for sightseeing or snorkeling.” Her snapping and the heavy military build up got me back to reality real fast.

We docked on the island’s sparsely occupied northside: タームの浜 (Taamu Beach). The large reef combined with low tide, prevented even our small craft from navigating the slicing dead corals. So we waded in.

“Just like basic, right?” I said.

“Yeah, just as wet without the kissing or cuddling.”

I wanted to laugh, but stopped myself when I couldn’t tell if she was joking or not. “Uh—”

“Wait\! Stop\! Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?”

“There again\! I definitely heard a boom.”

I strained my ears. All I heard was waves beating the hard shore and the beginnings of many insects scree-ing in the nearby unkempt grass. Then I saw great plumes of smoke coming from the south of the island.

“Shit. What’s happening down there?”

Pack over her head, Timeera called back, “We gotta move.”

# Bonta reunited with Meio, but…

**Deeper**

The walk took longer than it should have. Or maybe I'm just bad at measuring time now. Hard to say.

Ōkari moved ahead like she had a map written into her muscles. Broad shoulders parting the green. My legs followed—not because I wanted them to, but because the alternative was standing alone in vegetation that didn't have a name. 変な plants. Twisted in ways that made my eyes slip off them.

Iheya Island revealed itself slowly. Not like a photograph—like a secret being whispered. The coastal cliffs to the south gave way to terraced farmland, abandoned now, vines reclaiming the organized rows. The northern sky was different here. Cleaner. Sharper. Like someone had edged it with a blade. The air tasted of salt and something else. Something mineral. Something that made my teeth ache.

"The island has been waiting for people like you," Ōkari said, not turning around. "Do you know what a Divine Mission is, Bonta?"

"No," I said. My voice came out small. Like I was answering in class.

"It's a pattern. Three sons born into burden. Three designed to break the design. One to shadow. One to burn. One to—"

She stopped. A figure emerged from the tree line ahead—red eyes catching the dying light. Short. Athletic. Moving like the vegetation was *anticipating* her steps.

"Greetings from the deep green," Eien said. Her voice was pitched low, authoritative but melancholy. "I'm Eien. The roots have been waiting for you."

Ōkari smiled—a quick, knowing expression that passed between them like they'd orchestrated this entire moment together. Because they had. "Eien helps me understand what the island is saying. I help her translate."

"Redundant?" Eien asked.

"Necessary," Ōkari replied. They moved in sync then, flanking me like bookends.

The ocean opened up below us—that long curve visible through the trees. The northern beaches stretched pale and empty. No boats. No swimmers. Nothing that moved except wind through the palms. But even the wind seemed reluctant here, like it was afraid to disturb something.

"Your sister," Eien said, those red eyes fixing on me. "Meio. We found her three weeks ago on the northern beaches. She was already marked. Already listening."

"How could you possibly—"

"The plants showed us," Eien said simply. Then she hesitated. That indecisive flicker crossed her face. Should she say it? Shouldn't she? "The island isn't just geography, Bonta. It's alive. It's a receiver. And what it's receiving from the deep—"

"The Emergence," Ōkari finished, and there was no warmth in her voice now. "We don't call it a monster. That's what the old governments called it. We understand it better now."

"Understand what?" I asked.

"That it was always here," Eien said. "Sleeping. Waiting. And now it needs—"

"Witnesses," Ōkari said. They exchanged a look. Some confirmation passing between them. "People who can carry the knowledge of what's waking."

We reached a small parking area carved into the vegetation. A white farmer's truck sat waiting—old, sun-bleached, the kind you see all over the island doing work that doesn't have a name. Battered. But functional.

"Come on," Eien said, and she moved to the driver's seat like she'd done this a hundred times. Ōkari climbed into the passenger side. I stood there for a moment, staring at the open bed of the truck.

"Don't be slow," Ōkari called back.

So I climbed in.

The drive was short. Maybe ten minutes. But the landscape shifted. We moved away from the cultivated areas into something older. Wilder. The trees were different here—thicker, more ancient. The sky dimmed even though the sun hadn't set. When we stopped, we were at the edge of a clearing I could feel before I could see.

I climbed down from the truck bed, and that's when I noticed them.

People. Dozens of them. Standing in a formation that wasn't random. They were positioned in concentric circles, facing inward—toward the center of the clearing. Their postures were exact. Ceremonial. Like statues carved specifically for this moment. Their faces were calm. Empty. But their bodies were *tense* with anticipation. Ready. Waiting for something to begin.

"Come," Eien said, and she took my arm gently. "The circles are assembled."

We walked into the clearing—and the world *stopped*.

It was a tree. That was my first thought. Just a tree. But trees didn't *pose* like that. Trees didn't hold themselves at angles that made your eyes uncertain. The Ninto Hiramatsu Pine was enormous—impossibly wide, its trunk branching and rebranching into a canopy so vast it created its own weather beneath it. But that wasn't the thing that made my stomach drop.

The tree was *tensed*.

I'd never seen it before—never even known it existed until this moment—but I recognized the posture. It was the way a creature braces itself. The way something holds itself when it's about to move. The trunk curved in a way that suggested musculature. The branches splayed and twisted as if frozen mid-gesture. Like an enormous figure had been caught mid-stretch, mid-yawn, mid-*something*, and then simply stopped. Paused. Held in an uncomfortable, agonized pose that suggested not peace but suspended agony.

It was beautiful. It was terrible. It was a monster wearing the shape of a tree.

The circles parted slightly. And there—standing at the very center, directly beneath the tree's widest branches—

Meio.

My sister. Alive. Unchanged. Unchanged *except* for her eyes. They were empty. Still blue. Still Meio's eyes. But something was looking *out* of them that wasn't Meio anymore.

"Bonta," she said. Her voice was hers, but the rhythm was wrong. The inflection was too precise. "You came."

"Meio—"

I stopped thinking. Stopped everything. I just moved—toward her, pulling her into an embrace before I could second-guess it. She felt like Meio. She *smelled* like Meio. And something broke open inside me. The weeks of searching, the fear, the abandonment—it all came flooding out at once.

I was crying. Hard. Gasping into her shoulder.

"I found you," I said. "I found you, I found you, I found you—"

But her arms didn't tighten around me. They stayed loose. Receptive but not *present*. And when I pulled back to look at her face, to see her smile, to see *recognition*—

There was nothing there.

"What happened to her\!?" I demanded. My voice cracked. "Meio, wake up\! It's me—兄に\! Why can't you look at me? What's wrong with her\!? What the hell did you do\!?"

Meio's empty eyes tracked me, but they didn't *see* me.

Eien stepped forward. Her red eyes catching the failing light beneath the tree.

"We did nothing," she said, her low voice carrying that mournful certainty. "This was her Divine Mission to join us. And to call you to her."

Ōkari moved to stand beside Eien. When she smiled, it was gentle. Apologetic. Worse than cruelty.

"She was searching for you," Ōkari said softly. "And now you're searching for yourself."

I looked from Meio to the tree to the assembled circles to these two women who had unmade my sister into something hollow—

And I understood that I was not here to *save* Meio.

I was here to join her.

**\[ARCHIVIST NOTE \- JINHUA MA, 2076\]**

*Reading this description of my mother in that moment—empty-eyed, ceremonially positioned beneath the Ninto Hiramatsu Pine—I feel something calcify in my chest. The dread Bonta felt when he realized she was gone, that whatever she had become was not her... I understand it now. I have felt it. The circles were not spontaneous. This was orchestrated. There are documents I found among my father's effects—dated before his disappearance—detailing the cult's structure, their theology, what they believed the "Emergence" wanted. I will transcribe those separately. For now, I note only this: my mother was not the first separated one they found. And Bonta would not be the last they called.*

# Living hive betrayal: Shade POV

---

**LIVING HIVE: SHADE POV (FULL SCENE)**

Through the low trees we saw it. They moved in unison, sound turned down to a tickling trail through the ears as we lay low, waiting—breath held after great sniffs of hard mud earth, for the company-arranged villagers to pass.

The formation was too perfect. Wrong kind of perfect. The synch that comes from something other than training.

"Why are they moving like that?" Timeera asked, more annoyed than cautious.

"Must have something to do with the node."

"Or the island. Or Chrysalis."

"Chrysalis?"

I glanced at her. She was pale—paler than the pale she usually worked—and her jaw was doing that thing where she clenched it against something. Not fear. Something underneath fear. She covered her mouth to suppress a cough, her shoulders folding inward, and I felt that thing happen inside me. That *need* in her reaching for something in me. She didn't have to say it. I could feel it like pressure in the air between us.

*She's running on empty again.*

"We go back," she said, voice thin from the cough. "Me and her. Training together, back in the day. She made it. I didn't. The end."

Except it wasn't the end. The way she said *made it*—there was history in there. Competition. Maybe something worse.

The last of the villagers shuffled past, their eyes hollow-forward despite the attack the port had just taken. Company work. Company discipline. The masked soldiers escorting them moved with the same locked-jaw focus, until one of them glanced uphill. Toward us.

That's when I heard it.

"Contact, grid—" The voice cut through, *distinctly* Southern U.S. accent, all vowels and authority.

Not PLA. Not local.

American.

Timeera's entire body went rigid. Not surprise-rigid. *Recognition*\-rigid. The kind of rigid you get when the thing you've been taught to fear shows up wearing a different uniform.

"Shit," she whispered. "Get ready. They've spotted—"

"Go," I said, and we moved.

---

We broke from cover heading northwest, using the tree line for cover. The soldiers came after us in formation, and I squeezed off three rounds—

Nothing.

The bullets didn't fire. No, wait—they *fired*. I felt the recoil. But the shells themselves, as they emerged, looked *wrong*. Oxidized. Corroded. As if they'd been underwater for months in the three seconds they'd been in the chamber. The rounds fell like rust to the ground.

"My weapon's jammed," Timeera hissed, throwing her rifle aside.

We had maybe twenty meters before they closed in. Six soldiers. Maybe seven. Moving in that locked-jaw formation, and then—

They started to *vocalize*.

Not speech. Not quite singing. Something between the two, fractured and overlapping—like a dial-up modem trying to translate human language through digital compression. The sound layered, harmonics that shouldn't exist simultaneously bleeding through each other. *Trrrrch-hummmmm-BRZZZZZT-ahhhh-trrrrch.* Over and over, modulating, searching for a frequency that didn't exist, never quite finding it. The soldiers' mouths moved in unison, heads tilted at identical angles, and the vocalization intensified.

The decay accelerated.

My rifle's barrel was corroding in real time. The metal turning to powder, flaking off in my hands like it had been cursed. I could *feel* it happening—cellular-level rot spreading through the steel like infection. I threw it down and pulled my blade.

"Close quarters," Timeera said, her knife already drawn.

The soldiers were thirty meters out. Twenty. And I could see the sync now—not just movement, but *neural*. Their heads moved in parallel curves. Their breathing aligned perfectly. They weren't six individual soldiers; they were a single organism wearing six bodies, and that organism was coming at us with zero hesitation.

They hit like a coordinated wave. A punch aimed for my sternum, a kick from a second soldier, a grapple attempt from a third—all synchronized, all complementary. No wasted motion, no individual aggression—just pattern execution. I twisted, caught the fist on my ribs, and the *pain* told me they were stronger than they should be. Reinforced. Enhanced. Like us, except they'd surrendered the pretense of being individual.

I drove my knife up toward the first soldier's throat. He pivoted—too late to avoid it completely, but early enough that the blade caught shoulder instead. Blood, at least. Red. Human. That was something.

But there were five others.

Timeera was in the thick of it, knife working in short efficient arcs, her breathing controlled despite the cough that kept interrupting her. She was good—better than good. But there were too many, and they moved like one organism with six limbs, anticipating each other's defense, filling gaps before they opened.

*This is how it ends. This is it. Bleeding out in a village we didn't even know existed.*

A second soldier came at me, and I *felt* it then—that pull. That weight. The Exposure meter in my mind starting to climb, and I *knew* what I had to do and I *knew* it would cost me.

No choice.

I stepped back, raised my hands, and I *called it*.

**Echo Strike.**

Energy flooded out of me—not like fire, like *drowning*. Like something inside my chest was opening up, and the world was pouring in to fill the void. My hands moved, and the air *fractured*, and the soldier in front of me suddenly saw his own force reflected back at him, magnified, and the impact threw him sideways into the soldier behind him.

Both went down.

The Exposure spike hit me like a fist to the sternum. The crushing weight of it—the self-doubt, the certainty that I'd just made a mistake, that using the Dare was the wrong call, that I should have just *endured*, should have just *taken it*—washed over me. My vision tunneled. My hands were shaking.

*You're not strong enough. You never were. You rely on these power bursts like a crutch, and they're eating you alive, and everyone knows it, and—*

No. Not now.

Four soldiers left. Maybe five. Timeera had one pinned against a tree, her knife working. I pushed through the self-doubt fog and drove forward, blade held low.

A soldier came at me with a bayonet-strike. I sidestepped, grabbed his wrist, used his momentum against him. He went down hard. Another one swung for my head—I ducked, came up under his guard, and brought my elbow up. Cartilage cracked. He fell back.

Timeera was bleeding from a cut above her eye. Her breathing was ragged. We were losing. The soldiers kept coming, kept adapting, kept moving in that synchronized nightmare-dance, and I could feel the Exposure in my system like poison, making everything slower, heavier.

*This is it. This is where we die.*

Then everything *stopped*.

A figure emerged from the tree line behind the soldiers. Tall. So tall that the proportions seemed wrong at first—lanky, elongated, moving with a grace that had nothing to do with human biomechanics. Pale skin that looked almost luminescent in the fading light. Hair an impossible pink.

And her eyes—

Her eyes were *voids*. Black. Absolute. No iris, no pupil, just endless darkness where eyes should be, and in that darkness was intelligence so vast and cold it made my blood stop moving.

And her hands. Where fingers should be were *claws*—keratin protrusions that caught the light like bone edges, elongated and predatory, moving with mechanical precision.

Chrysalis.

But what shocked me was the *way* she moved.

She moved like the hive soldiers. In sync. The same locked-jaw precision, the same neural alignment. Except—

She was *independent*. The hive moved with her, not through her. Every soldier-organism shifted to accommodate her trajectory, and I realized in that moment: they weren't controlling her. She was conducting them.

She was the *frequency* they were all searching for.

The queen.

Chrysalis moved through the cluster of soldiers with economical violence. A palm strike to the temple of one—he dropped instantly. A sweep-kick into another's knee—it buckled, tendons compromised but not severed. She wasn't killing them. She was *systemizing* them. Each strike precisely calibrated to incapacitate without lethal damage, like she was following a script written into her DNA.

Twelve seconds. That's all it took.

When it was done, five soldiers lay unconscious or groaning. The sixth tried to run, and Chrysalis hummed—low, just a few notes, something that sounded like it came from a throat designed differently than human vocal cords, that dial-up modem compression made flesh—and the soldier *stopped*. He turned back toward her, and she incapacitated him with the same clinical efficiency. No wasted motion. No mercy. Just function.

Then she turned to Timeera.

"Have you told him?" Chrysalis asked. Her voice was thin, reedy, like it was being transmitted through damaged speakers, but it was *hers*. I could hear the intelligence underneath, crystalline and cold.

Timeera stood there, breathing hard, blood on her knife. Her hand was shaking—not from exertion. From something deeper.

Told me what?

"Tell me what?" I said.

Timeera looked at me. And in that look, I saw a woman standing at a crossroads—one path toward honesty, one toward survival.

She chose survival.

She moved, and there was a sound like a pressurized syringe, and I felt something spike into the base of my neck—

*No wait—*

---

**DARKNESS. DROWNING. NO DIRECTION TO MOVE.**

I woke to the worst horror of my life: I was *present* but *absent*. Consciousness without control. Awareness without agency.

The paralytic had rendered me a ghost in my own body.

I could *see*. My eyes moved—no, they didn't. They were fixed, pupils dilated, seeing everything, seeing nothing, trapped in the black of my own skull. I could *hear*. Sound came in, layered, distorted, like I was hearing it through water. I could *feel*—god, could I feel—every sensation of pressure, of movement, of the world happening *to* me while I screamed silently inside the tomb of my own meat.

*This. This is what sleep paralysis is. You're awake. You're aware. And you can't move. You can't scream. You can't do anything but watch.*

I was in a vehicle. Motion beneath me. The walls around me were soundproofed but not sight-proof. I could see shadows moving. Figures. Timeera was there. And Chrysalis.

And they were talking.

"Do you remember the facility?" Chrysalis's voice came through like it was filtered through static. "Bangkok. Before the island. Before I became this."

Timeera didn't answer, but I could hear the tension in her breathing.

"You told me to tell you if I was changing. You made me promise." Chrysalis's voice had a quality that might have been sorrow if it wasn't so *flat*, so precisely modulated. "I couldn't keep that promise. Or I kept it too late. Or I kept it in all the wrong ways."

"Quinn—" Timeera's voice cracked.

"Don't." It wasn't harsh. Just final. "That name belonged to someone who believed institutions could be reformed. Someone who thought compliance would protect her. That person got extracted to Okinawa and became a vector for something worse than any lab could design. That person is what I became."

I tried to move. My muscles didn't respond. My heart was hammering against my ribs like it was trying to escape. I was trapped. Completely trapped. Conscious and powerless.

"The C-Unit didn't fail," Chrysalis continued, and I could hear her moving, the sound of fabric shifting, the precise click of a syringe being manipulated. "They succeeded. They built me into the network. They gave me the ability to control it, to spread it, to *outdo* the pandemic threshold they'd modeled. I'm not a victim anymore, Timeera. I'm the operational implementation of everything they wanted."

"You're not." Timeera's voice was desperate. "You're still—"

"You need his DNA," Chrysalis interrupted. "That's why you've kept him close. That's why you couldn't leave him in the village. He's an antigen vector—his genetic material might slow the transformation. Might keep you functional long enough to matter. Isn't that right?"

Silence.

*No. No no no. She wouldn't. She couldn't.*

But she did.

"It's right," Chrysalis said, and I could hear something being extracted, something moving with the viscosity of living material. My material. My genetic code being stripped away like corrosion running backward through metal. "And the Americans who sent those contractors? They don't want data anymore. They want *containment*. They want to study what the C-Unit created and weaponize the mechanism. Timeera, you're not fighting the island. You're fighting the people who decided the island was worth the cost of occupation. And they have resources that make insurgency look like hobbyist resistance."

"So what, we just—" Timeera couldn't finish the sentence.

"You survive," Chrysalis said. "That's what we both learned. You survive first. You ask moral questions later, if there is a later. That was supposed to be enough. That was supposed to be *everything*."

I couldn't move. Couldn't speak. Couldn't do anything but *feel* myself being taken apart, extracted, weaponized.

In the darkness of my paralyzed consciousness, I understood:

*I had finally succumbed. The tomb of my own body had closed around me, and I was sealed inside, aware of every violation, every theft, every piece of myself being catalogued and stored and—*

# The Cult Channels the Monster to Destroy the 3rd Node

“Meio\! MEIO\! Wake up\! We have to leave\! To get back home\! Can you hear me\!?”

I shook her. I tasted tears. ヤバイ\! The commendable effort I gave to that endeavor amounted to nothing among the surrounding eyes.

I turned to Okashi and Eien. Both watched like they were watching a long Let’s Play, glazed attention accompanied occasional amusement. Though I guessed it was mostly reflex. A wet wind whipped by. Their casual clothes made the entire episode that much more bizarre.

“Bonta. You must stand with her. Nothing can sway her divine mission,” Eien’s words were lazy as grass.

“Is her ‘mission’ to stand in a damned field with you weirdos? We’re getting the hell away from here. Now\! Meio, let’s go\!” I forcefully stood, took her hand with the same vigor (how cold it was\!), then tugged. But like a stubborn cow, she jerked away, shook her head, and went back into the crooked circle.

Her hand went slack in mine just before she pulled away. When I looked down, her skin had that same pearl-gloss the others carried—faint, like something between her and translucence. When had that started? While we were searching? While I was asleep? The thought scooped a hollow in my chest.

“Meio… why?”

The earth stirred beneath my feet. A significant shudder. “An earthquake?” In the distance, ocean agony punched near with a pre-tsunami quiet that I cannot even fathom why *why* these crazy people don’t run to the hills. 

The earth shook again. Not prelude, response. They were counting on it. All of them stood rooted like they'd been planted here specifically to *receive* the quake, not endure it. Their eyes weren't up toward escape routes or toward the hills. They were tracking downward. Toward the roots. Toward the space where Eien had been breathing into that open sky.

A force beneath the canopy of this tree has them trapped. That same devil-bind has my sister.

I yelled, “Can’t you feel that\!? There’s a quake coming. Might even go into a tsunami\! You people need to get outta here\!” My head was surging with too many thoughts. 西日 late afternoon light dimmed behind low-night clouds.

Okashi made heavy steps toward me. With big sister energy, the kind I never had, she said, “She won’t go. We won’t either.”

Eien looked up at the sky. I freaked out when she opened her mouth to exam width, tongue out and all, expecting something to drop straight into her. I could see saliva tendrils glistening between her top and bottom teeth as she took belly-expanding breaths. Amazing boobs lifting and lowering in slow and heavy waves, I stared. Viewing the slick straining pink of the inside of her mouth felt beyond inappropriate, but I couldn’t look away. Stimulated fear short-circuited social decency, because there was no because. Just: *this is happening*, deal with it. Was she waiting for some cosmic candy to land in there? Something else? I felt like I shouldn’t be watching. Like I didn’t want to see the end of whatever she was craving to connect with her.

“What in the—?”

It was longer than I anticipated, but she closed her mouth then licked her thin lips. Drizzle hit my hair seconds later.

“It’s time.” Eien gazed at Okashi, then to me, but said to her while viewing me with those empty AI eyes. “Either he stays willfully, or he goes unwillfully.”

Both locked on to me, joining the other several dozen pairs in the ritual circle around the tree. But their eyes weren't on me. They were stacked, layered. On the surface they saw me, but their gazes were lasers fixed *through* the tree trunk, toward the soil, toward whatever was rising to meet them. I was a body in the way of something larger waking up. I felt this was my last chance to take voluntary action. The kind you make in a game that determines the quality of the end. Bad, good, best: which ending would it be?

Okashi said, “Bonta, your sister has made her mission acceptance. What will you do?”

I wanted to say: *But I don’t know what my mission is\! I don’t know what this is, why you wackos are in this field, under this god-blasted tree, standing in a coming storms, waiting to be washed away, standing ringed, mouths open wide like ready to swallow a long sweet potato whole. I don’t know why Timeera left me, or why or how Meio got here, or why the hell I’m here. Why do I feel taken by currents, too tired to even bob contrary to them?*

Of course, I said none of this. I just slumped my shoulders as the rain hit my back in earnest.

Okashi led me to my place beside Meio. Eien nodded, then went center circle to confer with an elder.

The fear of my youth was overharvested, spent, rotting in a field I never chose to stand in. It was no match for their worship of an invisible beast.

# RECOVERED DOCUMENT 847-G: Audio/Visual Fragment

\*\*Source:\*\* Iheya Island Security Feed \#4 (Basement Level)

\*\*Timestamp:\*\* 2026.04.17 \- 03:47-04:13 JST

\*\*Archival Note:\*\* Feed corrupted at 04:13:22 due to island-wide power failure. Audio quality deteriorates progressively.

\*\*ARCHIVIST COMMENTARY \[J. MA, 2076.09.12\]:\*\*

All he could do was smell and scream. At least that's what it appeared like in the feed. You'd think I'd be used to it by now— the wail of men in agony. But it still screws up my gut, which makes me clench and fearful (irrationally) for the life inside me.

Unruly is how I'd describe Shade's captor— Chrysalis. Black pearl eyes and claw-length fingers, her lips cracked and twitching beneath a rose pink mop of hair gives her the manner of an insect itching for a bite. In that dank dim hole, somewhere at the third node, they held him, suspended with rough rope from a low roof rafter while the skies cracked and darkened outside.

I've listened to this segment fourteen times now. I'll listen to it fourteen more before I'm done. That's what this work requires—bearing witness to the unbearable.

The feed shows Chrysalis circling beneath him. At 03:49:03, she cuts him down. Shade hits the concrete hard, and I hear the air leave his lungs. She hauls him into a metal chair, zip-ties his wrists to the arms. The chair is bolted to the floor. One camera angle captures it all.

"Where are they?" Her voice is almost playful. "Where are your brothers now?"

Shade doesn't answer. His jaw clenches. Blood from the rope burns on his wrists drips onto the concrete.

"Sun? Scorch?" She laughs, and there's something brittle in it. "No white knight riding in? No cavalry charge? Just you. Just you and me and this choice."

She drags something into frame. The mechanism is crude but purposeful—a metal arm with a syringe assembly mounted on articulated joints, positioned so Shade can reach it with his bound hands if he stretches. The syringe is full of something that looks like mercury mixed with ink. It catches the light wrong.

"Do you know what they did to us?" Chrysalis asks. She's not looking at him anymore. She's looking at something else, somewhere else. "Operation Charon. They made us into weapons. Then C-Unit happened, and suddenly we were \*inconvenient\*. Liability. So they left us. Left \*me\*. On an island not so different from this one, actually."

Shade's breathing changes. I note the timestamp: 03:51:14.

"I learned something there," she continues. "About survival. About what you have to be willing to give up." Now she looks at him directly. "So here's your test, little brother. Your proof of life through pain."

She activates something—I hear a click, then a rising whine. The frequency builds. It's not painful to me, listening through standard speakers fifty years later, but I watch Shade's face contort. His enhanced hearing. She's weaponizing it against him.

"Two choices," Chrysalis says over the noise. "Endure this until your eardrums rupture, until the hemorrhaging starts, until maybe your brain liquifies. Could take thirty minutes. Could take three." She gestures to the syringe. "Or inject yourself with that. Genetic suppressant. Crude, painful, but it'll shut down your enhancements. Stop the noise from killing you. Of course, it'll also feel like every cell in your body is tearing itself apart for about... well, however long you stay conscious."

The frequency climbs higher. Blood starts trickling from Shade's nose.

"The game is simple," she says. "Die as you are, or survive as something else. Just like I did. Just like everyone on this island had to."

I watch the timer in the corner of my screen. 03:53:22. 03:53:45. 03:54:01.

Shade's reaching for the syringe. His hands are shaking so badly it takes him three tries to position his arm. The mechanism brings the needle to his inner elbow. He has to press his arm down to trigger the injection. His resistance would be commendable if it weren't so futile—he's fighting both the restraints and his instinct for survival.

He does.

What follows is twenty-three seconds of the most visceral suffering I've documented in this entire archive. The veins in his arms darken immediately, black threads spreading up toward his shoulder, across his chest. His back arches against the restraints. The sound he makes—I won't describe it. Some things shouldn't be reduced to words.

The frequency cuts out. The silence is almost worse.

Chrysalis crouches in front of him. "Good," she says softly. "You chose transformation over death. Maybe you're strong enough for this after all."

Shade's eyes are unfocused. Blood runs from his nose, his ears. His lips move but no sound comes out.

At 04:08:17, I hear it. Distant but distinct—thunder. The storm they've been waiting for. And underneath it, something else. Voices. Hundreds of them. Rhythmic. Chanting something I can't quite make out through the degrading audio quality. They're coming from somewhere outside, moving closer.

Chrysalis stands, cocking her head toward the sound. Whatever's happening out there, it's shifting something in the air, in the tension of this room.

The lights flicker. Once. Twice.

At 04:13:22, the screen goes black.

The audio continues for another four seconds. In that darkness, I hear the storm breaking, the distant voices swelling to a roar, and something that might be Shade's labored breathing.

Then nothing.

## \[PARTIAL DRONE FOOTAGE FROM ABOVE IHEYA ISLAND\] \- ARCHIVIST POV

The entire frame appears to drop from view. Leaves lash at the lens. Wind so loud I had to silence the feed.

It wasn’t able to capture much, but the few seconds that were saved presented were night-darkened tree silhouettes bending, rustling in the rain. 

The circle of bodies was a crude target in front of that grizzled old tree. All had their arms outstretched in raptured surrender to that summoning ritual. My pulse pressed against the pen I held as I reviewed it. Like I was there.

I recognized Bonta Higa standing next to a short girl with black hair— his sister Meio. Reunited at last, but under those redoubtable gales? I can’t imagine what he must have been thinking. Bonta’s arms had a slackness. As if his shoulders couldn’t handle the strain. His eyes were closed, but he occasionally peeked them open to first look at his sister, then the sky, then the sea.

“See his face when the sky splits.” Again. That’s what I murmured as I rewound the clip for the fifth time. What can only be described as a “storm rupture” broke the air into a circular maw. Through the shaky drone’s camera, a dazzling sunset forged through and that’s when all the members of the circle, like petals of a closing flower, fell to their knees, smiling in supplication, hands reaching toward the heavens.

The sea grunted incredible splashes. Then the drone crashed.

Bonta was the only one without a smile.

# **\[FROM THE BURNED SCRAPS OF NOTE\] — SCORCH POV (COMBINED REVISION)**

**They didn’t know what hit ’em until I lit that bitch up.**

The storm outside was doing half the work for me. Wind battering the metal siding, rain hitting the walls in crooked slaps, thunder rolling like a busted engine someone kept trying to start. Every rumble dipped the lights again, deeper, longer. The blackout wasn’t clean. It flickered in dirty heartbeats—just enough to show me where the screams were coming from.

Shade’s screams.  
Not loud. But the kind that live in the gaps between sounds.

By the time I hit the basement corridor, the smell hit first. Rust, rot, old concrete sweating. Something like wet copper and fried nerves. Lightning flashed through a tiny window high on the wall—the brief white glare catching the damp, stained floors like a morgue that forgot to be sterile.

I moved fast. Too fast.  
Later, I’d look back and wonder how long I’d been sliding toward this version of myself.

*Prolepsis:* I’d see my hands later that night, trembling with leftover fire, feeling nothing.

I reached the doorway. The blackout grabbed the light again. When it stuttered back—

Shade. Strapped to a metal chair bolted to the floor. Head down. Arms zip-tied. Skin pale beneath bruises. Breathing shallow like each inhale cost him money he didn’t have. Blood on the floor under his chin— dark, thick, almost oily.

“Who the hell touched my brother?”

Something shifted in the corner.

Chrysalis rose into view.

Her body was a kid’s sketch, warped and hard to look at— extra long limbs, pink hair hanging limp, black pearl eyes that didn’t blink the right way. When she smiled, it wasn’t wide. It was *thin*. Nasty smugness. Fuck her.

“You brought the storm with you,” she said. Her voice was all static and sweetness rotting in a jar.

Behind her, I caught sight of Timeera Koi. Half-shadowed. Breathing fast. I’d seen her thirstin’ after Shade like she wanted his baby. Maybe she did. Maybe he liked her? I didn’t know which one it was. So I decided to lay off of her. She was lucky.

Timeera watched Chrysalis like she wasn’t sure if running or staying would kill her quicker.

She tried to speak. I raised a hand without looking away from Chrysalis.

“You betta get the hell outta here I’m not here for you.”

Timeera got the message and froze.

Chrysalis took a step toward me, claws flexing. “You shouldn’t have come, little spark.”

I laughed in a humorless way. 

“Whatever bitch. Spark this.”

The heat came out of me like a verdict.

White-orange flame slammed across the room, lighting up every droplet of damp air. Chrysalis took the blast square in the chest. Her body arched backward, hair catching fire in a bright pink flare. Her skin blistered instantly, then started to come off like a used candle. 

Shade’s head jerked at the light. “Scorch— wait…”

“Yeah, I’m here,” I muttered, stepping forward. “Ain’t nobody leaving here hurtin’ you.”

Chrysalis screeched like a rusty saw had dragged over her leg. She twisted, trying to push through the flames, her claws glowing red-hot. Summoning something probably. The hive wouldn’t make it in time.

“Why are you still standin’?” I flamed her again.

Second burst pinned her to the wall. Concrete cracked behind her back. The smell— god— the smell was like a **water bloom** that had rotted too long against the shore, blooming all at once, violently reeking.

Her screams turned wet as her legs buckled. But she still tried to crawl. Instinct or hate or training, kept her moving to respawn in this fight that was decided in seconds. 

“Stay the fuck down.” 

Third blast. The biggest.

Flame swallowed her whole. The room went white. By the time the light thinned, what remained of Chrysalis collapsed inward in a charred arachnoid way. 

Only then did I turn to Shade.

He was slumped, breathing like a man hunted through his own body. I grabbed the zip-ties, melted them off, caught him before he could fall.

---

A sterile purgatory for dead facts, that's where I work. The dehumidifier is a comforting sound, artificial and dry, pulling moisture from the air to protect the paper. The room smells of old cellulose and ionized dust. 

On my desk, the dossier for Subject 734-C sits in a pool of fluorescent light. It is a thin folder, barely a centimeter thick, yet it contains enough atrocity to drown the island.

I align the edges of the folder with the corner of my desk. Perfect right angles. Order is the only defense against what lies inside. I open it.

The first photograph is not of a person. It is of a frequency analysis—a jagged red waveform spiking against a black grid. The caption reads: *Infrasonic Event 44-Alpha. Decibel range: 190+. Effect: Liquefaction.*

I turn the page to the casualty photos.

The contrast is immediate. The room around me is regulated, but my insides rage. The images in my hands are hot chaotic. They riot on my nerves as I endeavor to catalog, to solve, not judge. 

**Subject 734-C. Codename: Cadence.**

The report describes a woman who became evidence of a natural disaster in human skin.

Begin vocal annotation.

*“Subject demonstrates a preference for close-quarters engagement when sonic suppression fails,”* the report states. The font is standard military sans-serif, rude in clarity. 

I look at the attached field note, scrawled by a recon scout who clearly did not expect to survive the shift.

> *“She doesn’t stop. The sound hits you first—like a pressure wave in your gut—and if you’re still standing, she’s on you. It’s not fighting. It’s dismantling. She takes pieces.”*

I underline *dismantling*. A precise word for a messy act.

The dossier details her “manual interventions.” That's the term the intelligence analysts used. 

*Manual intervention.* 

Fixing a stalled engine is the machanical image my mind conjures, which doesn't do the pictures justice. The reality is her victims are earless, with ripped grooves of gashes in the surrounding tissue in the shape of human teeth.

There is a footnote regarding the specific nature of these injuries. It notes a recurring pattern in the trauma to the cranial region of confirmed kills. The tactical logic is **clear-cut**: by removing the external auditory canal, she symbolically—and brutally—negates the target’s ability to process her primary weapon, even though they are already dead.

Why do this? I thought about it for a long time. 

I look at the word I have just written in the margin. *Symbolically.*

No. That is an error. There is no symbolism here. That would imply art, or religion. This is function. This is a child who was turned into a speaker, trying to turn off the listeners.

I cross out *symbolically*. I write *systemically*.

The next section details the Capybara.

The dossier attempts to categorize them as "biological support assets." It lists their weight, swimming speed, radiation requirements. It reads like a livestock inventory.

I flip to the after-action report from the Naha seawall breach.

> *“They came out of the surf like drift logs. Slow. Heavy. Then they hit the line. It wasn’t an animal attack. It was a kinetic strike. 150 kilos of wet fur and muscle moving at forty miles per hour. They didn’t bite. They crushed knees and pulverized skulls of the fallen. They herded the perimeter guards into the kill zone like sheep dogs pushing a flock into a thresher.”*

The contrast creates a dissonance in my mind. A normally docile animal acting with the tactical discipline of a soldier. A soldier acting with the feral instinct of a predator. The archive feels too small. The dehumidifier sounds less like a machine and more like a breath.

I force myself to focus on the data.

Cadence. The Sonic Child. The Casualty Engine.

The file argues that she is an aberration. A failure of the conditioning protocols. A "rogue element."

I look at the timeline of her surgeries. The installation of the piezoelectric filaments. The removal of her ability to hear quiet. A mind of circling soundwaves crashing within her cranium. The introduction of the "Sorrow-Man" AI to monitor her stress by remixing the voices of her dead friends. It must have been daily delirium. What kind of monster did they make?

I set the pen down. It rolls slightly, disrupting the parallel alignment I established earlier. I do not correct it.

She is not an aberration. She's a solved equation they wrote.

It's not madness. It's cause and effect, the most rational thing in this entire file.

I stare at the last photo. A blurry image of Cadence standing on a ridge, the silhouette of a massive, rodent-like shape beside her. She is looking off of the ship toward Shade's vessel speeding westward, toward what they assumed would be escape.

“Hey,” I said, softer than I intended. “Look at me. I got you. You hear me?”

His eyelid fluttered. “…you… came.”

“You didn’t think you could trust the fam? Nigga please, this war got you twisted. Somebody after you, I’ll always be there to kill em’” I said. 

The storm hammered the building, the wind howling like something wanted in. Weak emergency power stuttered overhead, throwing shaky stripes of light across the walls.

Timeera had bolted. Smart move.

Shade sagged against me, blood warm on my shoulder. I adjusted my hold, hauling him upright.

We moved toward the hall.

I took a last look at the thing formerly known as Chrysalis.

I should’ve felt something. Shock. Horror. Guilt. Something human.

Instead—

Nothing. Just a warm empty spot right behind my ribs where the fear used to live.

*Prolepsis:* Later tonight, lying awake listening to Shade breathe beside me, I’ll realize the killing didn’t disturb me. Not even a little. I’ll wonder when that started. When the line between monster and brother faded. When barbequing someone alive became the easy part.

The smell arrived before the visual confirmation.

It was not the ozone snap of impending weather, nor the familiar copper tang of battlefield arterial spray. It was sweeter. Cloying. The scent of meat left out in the sun until the fibers began to liquefy and sing.

*Worship,* the voice whispered. *It smells like worship.*

"It smells like inefficiency," I corrected, adjusting the gain on my auditory receptors. The wind tore at the ridgeline, screaming through the Nento Matsu Pine’s needles, but the noise below was distinct. A rhythmic, wet chanting. Synchronized respiration.

I crested the ridge.

The clearing spread out like a diagram in a pathology textbook. The great pine, that ancient parasite, stood center-mass, its roots knuckling up from the soil like arthritic fingers. And around it—the infection.

Fifty of them? Sixty? They formed concentric circles, swaying with a motion that defied individual muscular control. They were not moving; they were *being moved*. The tree was pulling the strings of their nervous systems.

*Look at them. Collaborators.*

"Hosts," I muttered. My HUD flickered, trying to lock onto individual heat signatures, but they bled together into one massive, feverish organism. "They are providing biomass for the Node. They are feeding it."

*They are opening the door. Do you see the root system? It’s pulsing.*

I zoomed in. The voice was correct. The bark of the Nento Matsu was no longer wood; it was flexing. A muscular contraction running up the trunk, pumping something dark from the soil into the canopy. The cultists’ chanting accelerated, a dissonant frequency that made my teeth ache.

They weren't just worshipping. They were summoning. They were the fifth column, the biological key turning in the lock of my island.

*Scorch would burn them,* the voice suggested. *He would enjoy the crackle.*

"Scorch is a blunt instrument. Fire is messy. Fire leaves carbon shadows." I stepped out from the tree line. The wind whipped my coat, but I felt perfectly still. My heart rate was a flat, boring line. "We require sterilization."

*Then use the gift. Use the inheritance.*

*Cinder was crude,* the voice whispered, *but generous. Nice of him to lend you the thermal schematic before he expired.*

"He was a volatile variable," I murmured, checking the internal reservoirs. "But his architecture was instructive. The C-Unit prototypes understood the necessity of total expenditure."

*American hardware. Chinese software. A beautiful bastardization. Just like you.*

"I am not a bastardization," I said, though the output logs suggested otherwise. "I am the correction."

I hesitated. The calculations scrolled behind my eyes. The Coronal Discharge was theoretical. A high-frequency radiation purge. Clean. Invisible. Absolute. But the energy requirements exceeded my internal capacitors by a factor of three.

*You are not alone. You are a triad. Open the valve.*

"That is a violation," I whispered. "They are depleted. Shade is… damaged."

*They are batteries. You are the weapon. Does the gun apologize to the bullet?*

The chanting reached a crescendo. The air above the pine began to shimmer, the reality of the sky tearing open like wet paper.

I had no choice. To save the organism, you must excise the tumor.

I stopped ten meters from the outer circle. No one turned. No one broke their trance. They were already dead; they just hadn’t ceased metabolic function yet.

I closed my eyes and reached down—not into the earth, but into the blood.

I found the frequency. The Janus gene. The triple-helix knot that bound us across the archipelago.

I pulled.

It wasn't a gentle tap. It was a violent, hydraulic siphon. I felt the resistance instantly—Shade’s exhaustion, a muddy, terrified confusion; Scorch’s jagged, volcanic panic. I ignored their silent screams. I gripped their vitality and *wrenched* it toward me.

My veins flooded with stolen white fire. My skin felt tight, threatening to split. The world slowed to a crawl. I could see the individual droplets of saliva flying from the lead chanter’s mouth. I could see the dust motes suspended in the storm.

*Do it. Clarify the board.*

I opened my eyes. I didn't raise a hand. I didn't shout. I simply opened the vents of my containment suit and released the hold.

**Protocol: Coronal Discharge.**

It began as a sound—a high-pitched whine, like a dog whistle amplified to the volume of a jet engine.

The reaction in the clearing was instantaneous.

The air boiled.

I saw movement at the periphery—shadows scrambling away from the center of the mass. Outliers. Statistically insignificant variables fleeing the sterilization zone. I did not track them. I focused on the core.

The wave hit.

It was invisible, a wall of agitated microwaves snapping outward from my position.

The chanting stopped. Not because they chose to stop, but because their vocal cords ossified in mid-vibration.

There was no blood. The water inside their cells flash-boiled. Their eyes turned to white, cooked albumin. They didn't fall immediately. For one second, the entire circle stood rigid, steam whistling softly from their tear ducts and nostrils, a choir of tea kettles screaming in the silence.

Then, gravity remembered them.

They collapsed in unison. A wet, heavy thud.

The Nento Matsu shuddered. The radiation withered its needles instantly, turning the lush green canopy into a grey, skeletal cage. The pulsing in the trunk ceased. The dark energy dissipating into harmless vapor.

The connection to my brothers snapped shut. The siphon closed.

Silence rushed back into the void, heavy and judging.

I stood alone in the center of the graveyard. The smell of rot was gone, replaced by the sterile, cooked scent of a hospital incinerator.

I checked my diagnostics. My hands were trembling.

Then, the flutter.

My heart skipped a beat, then two. A chaotic, avian thrashing against my ribs. I pressed a hand to my chest, gasping as the arrhythmia took hold. The cost of the siphon. The engine sputtering after red-lining. I waited for the palpitations to smooth into a rhythm, but they lingered—a jagged reminder of the energy debt I still owed.

I felt hollowed out. A shell.

But looking at the stillness, at the absolute order I had imposed on the chaos, I felt something else.

*Clarity.*

"Node Three is neutralized," I said to the empty air.

*See?* the voice asked, settling into the back of my skull like a satisfied cat. *Wasn't that easier than talking?*

"Yes," I replied. I stepped over a body— a woman, her face frozen in a mask of cooked devotion—and began the long walk to the coast. "Much easier."

**CONTINUITY HOOK:** The siphon event has physically compromised Shade and Scorch, leaving them vulnerable right before the sound of the blast reaches them.

Everything hurts, but the silence hurts the most.

We found a hostel half-eaten by the jungle. The sign out front is covered in kudzu, but the roof held. Scorch found a vending machine that wasn’t completely dead—some solar battery backup miracle—and kicked it until it spit out two lukewarm cans of Okinawan tea.

He sat opposite me on a rotting tatami mat, spinning a combat knife on the floorboards like a dreidel.

"You look like shit," he said.

"You look like a coloring book," I shot back, eyeing the fresh ink crawling up his neck.

He laughed. It was a rusty sound, something that hadn't been used since we were kids. Since before the Janus gene. Before the blockade.

"Remember *Gunstar Heroes*?" he asked, watching the knife blur. "Seven Force? That boss with the seven forms?"

"Fixed Shot," I said, the memory hitting me like a physical ache. "You always hated playing Fixed. Said it felt like wearing a straitjacket."

"Because it is. You have to stop to shoot. You plant your feet and you die. I played Free Shot. Move and shoot. Flow." He stopped the knife. "We used to beat that game on Hardest without dying. One life bar. Shared credits."

"We had to," I said, cracking the tea. It tasted like rust and jasmine. "Mom would pull the plug if we played past nine."

"Yeah. Limits." He looked out the window where the storm was brewing over the northern ridge. "We had limits then."

The air shifted. The nostalgia evaporated, replaced by the humid, heavy reality of the war. Scorch’s leg started bouncing. The *diabatic* shift. He couldn't stay cool for long. His internal temperature was always rising.

"Where were you?" he asked. The playfulness was gone. "When Cinder had me pinned? When the JSDF was turning Naha into a parking lot? When the sky tore open?"

"I was looking for you," I said, keeping my voice level. "I was following orders."

"Orders." He spat the word. "I was bleeding, Shade. I was out here eating dirt, sleeping in craters, dodging drones, killing PLA scouts, burning nodes, watching the island turn into a horror show, waiting for a brother who was too busy polishing his boots and saluting a flag that doesn't give a fuck about him."

He leaned forward, the *congeries* spilling out of him, a verbal avalanche.

"I saw the botched clones in the labs, the starved locals in the camps, the failed augmentations screaming in the dirt, the politicians lying on the broadcast, the ships burning in the harbor, the ash, the rot, the silence. I saw it all while you were filing reports."

He took a breath, his chest heaving.

I let the silence hang there for a second. "You don't like congeries? Yo uncultured ass."

He blinked. The tension snapped, just for a second. "Sounds like you summoning ghost wit yo 'conjurings.'"

"Ha funny," he sneered, but the corner of his mouth twitched. "Only ghost here is the ghost of yo 'gains.' You always did have dem packaged ones. Deflatable ass muscles. Ain't nobody scared."

"All these years you still shook," I said, leaning back against the wall. "Where'd yo muscles go?"

"Hibernation," he said, tapping his temple. "Gathering strength for winter. Which looks like it never comes here. So..."

"So... no muscles. I can see that."

"Nigga fuck you."

We laughed. It faded into the damp air, leaving us just sitting there, breathing.

He drank his tea, his eyes softening as he looked past me, toward the jungle.

"We need to get off this rock," Scorch said.

"Blockade is still up. Nobody leaves."

"I know the blockade is up. I'm talking about the *program*. The whole setup." He crushed the can in his hand. "I feel it closing in. The walls."

"Why did you sign the paper, Lock? Back then. Dad was already gone. You didn't have anyone to impress."

"Dad was gone, yeah. But he wasn't *gone*." Scorch stared at the crushed aluminum. "You know that feeling. Like he was still standing in the doorway, waiting for me to mess up. I wanted to show him—show his ghost, I guess—that I could handle the voltage. That I was reliable." He looked at me. "What about you? You were always the smart one. You knew what they were doing to us."

"I was always going to join something," I said quietly. "I wanted to be part of something bigger. A cause. A shield." I looked at my hands, scarred and shaking. "I just didn't know the thing could be so big that it crushes you whole. You don't see the teeth until you're already in the throat."

Scorch nodded slowly. "Yeah. The throat."

He leaned back, the shadows from the trees outside cutting across his face.

"What about Sun?" he asked. The voice was softer now. "Where do you think his head is at?"

I hesitated. I looked at the condensation dripping down my tea can. I didn't want to tell him. It felt like handing him a live grenade. But looking at him now—scarred, volatile, but still my brother—I realized I didn't know how much time we had. Secrets were a luxury for the living, and we were barely that.

"I saw him," I said. "Before Cinder. Before the separation."

"And?"

"He's... different, Lock. He's not the Captain anymore. He's something else." I took a breath. "He told me that if he saw you again... he would kill you."

Scorch didn't flinch. He didn't yell. He just stared past me, out the window, at the black wall of the jungle. His eyes were wide, unblinking, reflecting the faint starlight. He looked like he was trying to solve a math equation that had no answer.

The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating.

Then, the void opened.

One second, I was sitting there, watching his stillness. The next, it felt like someone had opened a drain plug in the bottom of my stomach.

My knees buckled.

"Whoa," Scorch gasped, grabbing the window frame. The metal groaned under his grip, heating up instantly to a dull cherry red. "Who pulled the plug?"

It wasn't just fatigue. It was a violent, hydraulic siphon. I felt my breath hitch, my heart stuttering like a bird trapped in a box. It felt like my blood was being magnetized, pulled north, toward the mountains.

"Sun," I wheezed, hitting the floor. "It feels like… Sun."

Scorch roared, a sound of pure frustration. "He's taking it\! He's taking the juice\!"

My vision grayed out. I could feel the connection—the Janus gene flaring hot and bright, a three-way highway that was currently strictly one-way. Sun was drinking us dry.

Then, the release.

The pressure snapped off as quickly as it had arrived. I gasped, sucking in air that suddenly felt too thin.

And then the sound arrived.

*BOOM.*

A dull, flat crack rolling down from the mountains. Not an explosion, but an implosion. The sound of a vacuum sealing shut.

Scorch was vibrating. Literally vibrating. The heat coming off him was turning the damp air into steam. His tattoos were writhing, the ink seemingly boiling under his skin.

"He did it," Scorch hissed, his eyes wide, pupils blown to pinpricks. "He broke the rule."

"Lock, calm down," I said, forcing myself up. My own hands were shaking. I could feel the *Other* pushing against the back of my mind—my own suppressed abilities, the shadow-walking, trying to surface to defend against the threat.

"Calm down? He just ate us, Shade\! He used us as a battery\!"

Scorch turned. A flame licked up his arm, consuming his sleeve. The tatami mat beneath his boots began to smoke.

"I have to go," I realized. The thought was crystal clear. *He is going critical.*

"Stay away from me," Scorch warned, clutching his head. "I can't… the regulator is blown."

"Lock—"

"RUN\!" he screamed, tears boiling into steam on his cheeks. "THE FLAG LEFT US HERE, SHADE\! IT LEFT US HERE\!"

He didn't aim at me. He just exploded. A sphere of heat expanded from his chest, blowing out the windows and turning the tea cans into molten slag.

I was too slow. The pressure wave hit me, throwing me back against the rotting wall. I raised my arms, bracing for the burn, the skin on my forearms tightening—

A blur of motion.

Something cool and hard slammed into my side.

"Move, you idiot\!"

Timeera.

She hit me with the force of a linebacker, tackling me through the rotted floorboards just as the room above turned into a blast furnace. We crashed into the crawlspace, mud and darkness swallowing us.

Above, Scorch screamed—a sound of pure, unadulterated heartbreak.

Then, footsteps. Heavy, panicked, running away into the jungle.

"He's gone," Timeera whispered, pinning me down in the mud. Her combat fatigues were singed at the shoulder. The smell of burnt synthetic fabric mixed with the wet earth. "He's running."

"He didn't mean to," I gasped, staring up at the cracks in the floorboards where orange light still flickered. "Sun… Sun forced him."

"Sun just declared war on everyone," she said, checking a burn on her arm. "Including you."

**CONTINUITY HOOK:** Timeera is injured (minor burn), Shade is drained, and Scorch is loose in the jungle, likely heading toward the next Node in a blind rage.

\[02:14 AM\]

The retching stops, eventually.

I gripped the porcelain with both hands, knuckles bleaching white, waiting for the room to stop spinning. The taste in my mouth wasn't just bile. It was the flavor of a nine-volt battery pressed to a wet tongue—metallic, electric, sharp.

I pulled myself up to the sink. The faucet hissed, spitting cold water that I splashed against my face. When I looked up, the woman in the mirror seemed like a stranger occupying my skin.

Dark circles, violet and bruised, had pooled under my eyes. My skin, usually warm, looked like parchment stretched too tight over a frame. The digigenomic resonance was eating me. It started as a twisting in my **foregut**, a biological rejection of the digital poison I was ingesting, before rising to purge everything else.

"You look like hell," I whispered to the reflection.

The reflection didn't argue.

\[02:30 AM\]

I sat back at the desk. The physical drive—the "Black Box"—hummed against the mahogany.

I had been afraid to look too closely at the metadata. But the sickness was a signal. My body knew something my mind was refusing to process. I bypassed the standard read-only protocol and accessed the file’s creation history.

The screen blinked. The encryption dissolved.

\> CREATOR ID: AGENT RYU (LI MA).

\> DATE MODIFIED: OCTOBER 12, 2070\.

The air left the room.

October 12, 2070\. That was the day my father died.

I remembered the hospital room. The sterility. The silence. The doctors said it was an aneurysm, a sudden, catastrophic bleed. But looking at this timestamp, at the exact minute the file was uploaded, looking at the code that he must have punched in with dying hands, I finally understood.

He wasn't editing this file. He was saving it.

He spent decades building this. The Type-B Archive. And the moment he finished—the moment he tried to push it to a secure server—someone pushed back. They didn't just kill him. They wiped him.

\[02:45 AM\]

I opened the folder he died to protect. It contains the global reaction to the Node 3 Massacre.

**\> ARCHIVE FRAGMENT: GLOBAL NEWSWIRE (NOVEMBER 2026\)**

They all knew. The Americans called him a criminal. The Chinese called him a failure.

But there was one last attachment. A text file from Ryū.

I hesitated. Dad never wasted words. If he wrote something down, it was because he couldn't say it, or because saying it would get you killed.

I opened it.

*"The timeline is a lie."*

I scrolled down.

*"The light didn't save us."*

And then, at the bottom:

*"Don't look for the man who did it."*

I stared at the screen. The nausea returned, sharper this time. He knew. He knew they were coming for him.

**With the taste of iron still heavy on my tongue, with the hum of the hard drive vibrating through the desk and into my bones, and with the sudden, terrifying clarity that my father’s natural death was actually a professional execution, I realized the question wasn't what was in the box.**

The question was: *Who killed him?*

Hope costs more than I can pay. So I don't buy it. I buy rice, diesel, because they give you time. Sometimes in secret, I wish time would speed up so I could see my son again. I haven't stopped seeing him in the face of strangers, but I don't look for him anymore either, it's been long enough. At least we still have this sanctuary, Yonaguni, but I feel the heat rising today, like an oncoming sickness. Nature knows how to deal with it, I trust. To cure it before it comes on is impossible though, so I ignore the gossips and hearsays to focus on today.

Because the war is a shout in the north, but here on Yonaguni, it is dead silence.

I sat on the porch of the clinic, peeling a sweet potato. I used the small knife, the one with the blade ground down to a silver sliver. You don’t waste steel here. You don’t waste anything. The skin of the potato I saved for the compost; the flesh I saved for me.

Higa was there, of course. The old man is like barnacles on a hull—impossible to scrape off. He was sitting on an overturned crate, mending a net that should have been retired ten years ago.

"They say Naha is burning," he said.

He didn't look up. His fingers, knotted like ginger roots, worked the nylon thread.

"They say a lot of things, *ji-chan*," I said. I sliced a disc of potato. It tasted of starch and dry earth. "Last week they said the Americans had a laser that boils blood. The week before, they said the Chinese Navy was walking on water. *Baka* stories."

Higa grunted. "The radio says the blockade is real. The Seventh Fleet. The PLAN. No ships in, no ships out."

"The radio is a liar box." I spat a bit of grit onto the ground. "It eats batteries and gives you headaches. Waste of time."

I looked out past the pastures. The sugar cane was bowing low, trembling. The wind here hunts. It screams over the cape, looking for something to break. But I am reliable. I don't break. I stay here, guarding a clinic with no doctor and a cabinet full of expired pills, because someone has to.

"We are a sanctuary," Higa insisted, his voice thin. "Too small to target."

"We are a crumb," I told him. "And hungry dogs don't ignore crumbs."

I stood up. My knees popped. The sun was climbing, bleaching the sky until it hurt to look at it.

"Go home, Higa. Heat is coming. Don't let the ghosts in."

He gathered his net, looking disappointed that I didn't want to panic with him. "The birds are quiet today, Zima. Even the crows."

"Maybe they are smarter than you."

I watched him shuffle away. I hate it when people waste my morning with fear. Fear is expensive. It costs calories.

I did my rounds. I checked the cistern (full), the generator (off, saving fuel), and the paddock.

The horses were restless. My favorite, the stallion *Gajumaru*, was standing by the fence. He’s a Yonaguni pony—short, thick-necked, and usually calm. Today he was huffing, stomping his hooves.

And he was excited. Fully extended. His member was hanging down like a fifth leg, massive and pink against his dark coat, swaying as he kicked at the flies.

"Put that away," I told him, clicking my tongue. "Have some shame. There is no mare for you today."

He ignored me, snorting at the ocean. Even the animals felt the pressure. The air was thin, brittle, like dried leaves ready to crumble.

Zima checked the perimeter of the clinic. Dr. Cote had left three years ago, when the first destroyers appeared on the horizon, leaving Zima with the keys and a cabinet full of expired antibiotics. Before the war, tourists used to hike up here looking for the filming set of *Dr. Koto*, expecting a miracle worker on a bicycle and a tearful sunset. They found Cote instead—a man who hated the show, hated the tourists, and ran the moment the real shooting started.

A small thing, looking like a **bilby** or some lost bandicoot, scuttled under the fence. It dug into the dirt near the water trough, burying itself deep.

"Smart," I said. "Hide."

Then the sky tore open.

It wasn't a missile. Missiles scream high and sharp. This was a roar—a sound like the earth cracking its knuckles. A streak of fire painted a jagged line through the clouds, turning the mid-morning blue into a blinding white scar.

It didn't hit the town. It didn't hit the airfield.

It slammed into the ocean, near the sea caves at the East Cape.

The ground punched my feet. I was thrown back against the clinic wall, hard. *Gajumaru* shrieked, finally retracting his excitement as he bolted for the back of the paddock. A plume of steam, miles high, erupted from the coast.

I stood up. I dusted my trousers. My heart was hammering, a fast drum in my chest, but I was not afraid. I was angry.

*My beach.*

I touched the amulet at my throat. The salamander glass was hot. My skin prickled, the melanin darkening, my blood shifting gears. I could feel the heat source from here, three miles away. It was heavy.

"Trouble," I said to no one.

I grabbed my walking stick and the medical kit. I grabbed the big canteen.

*Nankuru naisa.* It will work out.

But first, I have to clean up the mess.

The sea caves usually smell of salt and cold rot. Today, they smelled of sulfur and cooked meat.

I scrambled down the goat path. My boots slid on the shale. The closer I got, the hotter it became. The air shimmered, warping the world like a bad dream. By the time I hit the sand, the temperature was pushing 130 degrees.

The tide pool was boiling. Actual, rolling boil. Dead fish floated on the surface, their eyes white.

"Waste," I hissed. "Good protein, wasted."

In the center of the crater, surrounded by a ring of fused, glassy sand, a man was trying to stand up.

He was huge. Broad shoulders, heavy muscle. And he was Black—his skin the color of deep charcoal, but glowing from the inside out, like iron sitting in a forge. Veins of magma-orange light pulsed under his dermis.

He wasn't wearing a suit. He was wearing fire.

He stumbled. His fist hit the sand, and the sand *ran*, melting into liquid silica.

I stopped at the edge of the heat. My lips felt like paper. My tongue clicked against the roof of my mouth—*tck-tck-tck*—my sonar mapping the space. The returns were fuzzy, distorted by the heat waves.

"Stay back," the man groaned.

His voice was a rock grinder. He looked up, and I saw his eyes. No pupils. Just pits of white fire. He looked exhausted. He looked like he had been burning since the world began.

"You are cooking my fish," I said.

I stepped into the circle.

The heat slapped me. It was a physical weight. My vest started to smoke, the synthetic threads curling up and dying. But my skin loved it. My amulet sang against my chest bone, drinking the thermal energy. I felt strong. I felt awake.

The man—this burner—recoiled. He held up a hand to push me away.

"I said back\!" he roared. "I'll melt the meat off your bones\!"

"You are not that hot," I lied.

I walked through the steam. I walked until I was looking down at him. He was terrifying, yes. A walking bomb. But he was also crying. The tears evaporated before they could touch his cheeks, leaving salt trails on his burning skin.

He wasn't a soldier. He was a hurting thing.

I knelt. The sand was hot enough to melt my soles, but I didn't care.

"Who are you?" he rasped. He stared at my face, at my skin that wasn't blistering. "Why aren't you ash?"

"I am the landlord," I said. "And you are trespassing."

I pulled the canteen. I didn't offer it. I unscrewed the cap and splashed the water right on his chest.

*Hiss\!*

The water exploded into steam. He screamed—a sound of shock—but the blinding white glow on his pectorals faded to a dull, sullen red.

He gasped, sucking in the air. He looked at his hands. He looked at me.

"Where is this?" he demanded. "Where is the squad?"

"Gone," I said. "Just you. And the dead fish."

I offered him the rest of the canteen. "Drink. Before you evaporate."

He took it. His hand was shaking. He looked at the metal, then at me. He was suspicious. Good. Suspicion keeps you alive.

He tipped his head back and drank. The water turned to steam in his throat, venting out of his nose, but his shoulders dropped an inch.

"We are far away," I told him. "The war is a rumor here. You are too loud."

He lowered the empty canteen. His eyes, slowly returning to a dark, human brown, locked onto mine.

"The war isn't a rumor," he said. His voice was heavy, like a stone dropping in a well. "I *am* the war."

I took the canteen back. It was hot.

"Well," I said, standing up and offering him a hand. "Then you better learn to be quiet. Because I have neighbors, and I don't like noise."

The ache wasn't physical. It was the memory of the chair in the Chrysalis black site—the way she’d ramped up the frequency until my eardrums bled, forcing me to choose between the noise and the needle. I chose the needle. I chose the suppressant that turned my veins black and shut down the parts of me that made me *more*. I didn't break then. But this... this running? It was doing what the torture couldn't.

I stopped, leaning my weight against a pillar that was encrusted with dead barnacles. The resort had been reclaimed by the sea years ago, before the water receded, leaving behind a skeletal architecture of rot. Through the shattered lobby windows, the island stretched out in a panorama of indifference.

Beneath the haze of the day, the ocean here was different than in Naha. It was a deeper, more violent blue—a cobalt bruise that went down forever. The wind whipped across the rolling sugarcane fields, flattening the crops in waves that looked like a green sea mirroring the blue one. Grass rustling with no man or animal in them was the constant sound. Below us, the small village of Eef sat abandoned, the roofs of the houses caved in like broken teeth.

It was beautiful. It was empty. It didn't care about war.

"You're stopping again," Timeera whispered.

She was ten meters ahead, moving through the shadows like a wraith. She didn't look back. She didn't have to. She could hear me thinking.

"I'm checking the perimeter," I lied. "We need to know if they followed us from the ferry."

"They didn't," she said. "If they had, we'd be dead. The search team at the dock was thorough. Too thorough. They weren't looking for stowaways. They were looking for *us*."

I grunted. She was right. We’d barely slipped off the cargo deck when the Kumejima port authority started tossing the hold. We were supposed to be halfway to Taiwan by now. Instead, we were stuck on another rock, looking for another boat, while the clock ticked down.

Timeera stopped. She turned slowly. In the gloom of the lobby, her face was a pale mask. She looked worse than me. Her skin had a gray, dusty quality, like old paper left in the sun. Her eyes were too big for her face, wide and wet, tracking me with a slow, deliberate lethargy.

"I can barely carry myself," she said.

*Liar,* I thought. *You're not just tired. You're rotting from the inside out. I can smell it. It smells like expired produce.*

"Then keep moving," I said aloud. "The Deep Sea facility is downstairs. Sub-basement. If the pumps are still offline, it'll be dry."

We moved past the reception desk. A skeleton in a floral shirt sat behind it, slumped over a guest registry that had turned to pulp. I ignored it. The dead were just scenery now.

I focused on the mission. Every step was a calculation. Iheya was burning—Scorch had made sure of that. We’d scrambled onto that ferry in the chaos, thinking we were clever. Thinking we could ride the panic all the way to Taipei. But the blockade was tighter than we thought.

*Why does it always feel mashed in the middle?* I thought. *The beginning of the war was clear. The end... maybe that will be clear too. But this part? This hiding in cargo holds and flooded hotels while my brothers rail at the world? This is just noise.*

I thought about Scorch. I thought about Sun. There seemed to be no way to bridge their perspectives. That was nothing new. Even when we were young, I only remember intense interactions between them. Sun and Scorch at the windows, me arms compressed in the middle seat-- bitch, that's what I remember.

Things only intensified as we got older. That 8 year age gap was a mawed rift. I felt I was at the bottom of it, shouting upwards to two sides who couldn't or wouldn't hear me.

"You still there?" Timeera asked.

"Of course."

"It's just you're more dull than usual today. Wanna talk about it?"

"Not with you."

"Look... I know you don't trust--"

For some reason I snapped, lost my shit. I spun and wrenched her arm. She yelped. I hadn't expected that.

"Of course I don't fuckin' trust you."

She said between breaths, "Well then why not just leave me huh? Why not just kill me here Shade?"

All I could do was return an intense glare.

"You won't, because you're not like them, your brothers. I see it in you."

"You don't know a damn thing about me. Or us."

"I knew enough to find you. To save you. Maybe even like you. But I know clearly that you have standards, even in the worst of times like this. You still want to believe. In them, this world, in me. Am I wrong?"

I released her with a shove. "We need to keep going. We can't be spotted."

I walked ahead, but I heard her say with husk, "That was some grip. Wish it was harder."

***

We reached the stairwell. It was dark, smelling of stagnant water and mold.

"Light," Timeera said.

She cracked a chemlight. The green glow washed over the concrete walls, revealing graffiti that had been scratched into the paint. *GOD IS HUNGRY.* *NO SHIPS.* *THE WATER LISTENS.*

"Cheery," I muttered.

"Watch your step."

We descended. The air grew colder, heavier. It pressed against my chest. I could feel the dampness seeping into my clothes, a phantom itch that I couldn't scratch.

The sub-basement was a cavern of pipes and tanks. This had been the Kumejima Deep Sea Water Research Center—a place where they pumped cold, nutrient-rich water from the bottom of the ocean to make expensive salt and cosmetics. Now, it was a tomb.

But it was dry.

"Clear," Timeera said, sweeping the room with her rifle. She checked the corners. She checked the vents. Professional. Efficient.

*And dying,* my mind whispered. *Look at her hands. Tremors. She's fighting to keep the gun steady.*

She lowered her weapon and slumped against a large filtration tank. She slid down until she hit the floor, exhaling a breath that rattled in her chest.

"We're safe," she said.

"For now." I limped to a workbench. I swept a pile of rusted tools onto the floor and sat on the edge. "Cadence is out there. He's not going to stop sweeping the island just because we found a hole."

"He can't hear us down here. Too much concrete."

"He doesn't need to hear us. He just needs to wait. We have no food, no water. We have..." I checked my watch. "Maybe six hours of daylight left. We need to find a boat. A real one this time. Not a ferry full of refugees and PLA checkpoints."

Timeera didn't answer. She was digging in her pack. She pulled out a bottle—a dark glass cylinder with a faded blue label.

*612.* Deep Sea Lager.

"Found it in the kitchen," she said. She popped the cap with the edge of her knife. It hissed. "It's warm. And probably skunky."

She took a long pull, her throat working. Then she held it out to me.

"Truce," she said.

I looked at the bottle. I looked at her.

"You tried to kill me in Naha," I said.

"C'mon. You're still butthurt about that? Imma need you to get over it. I was following orders after all."

"You shot my drone."

"I missed your head."

"Barely."

"Take the drink, Shade. Or keep moping. I don't care."

I took the bottle. The glass was slick with her sweat. I wiped the rim—a petty gesture, I knew, but I did it anyway—and drank.

It was awful. Flat, bitter, metallic. It tasted like the room smelled.

"Delicious," I said.

"It's calories."

We sat in silence for a long time. The only sound was the drip-drip-drip of condensation falling from the pipes.

"Why did you turn?" I asked. I didn't look at her. I looked at the phosphorescence growing in the corner of the room—a patch of glowing algae that pulsed with a faint, rhythmic light.

"I didn't turn," Timeera said. "I woke up."

"That's the line. That's what they all say. 'I saw the light. I saw the truth.' It's cult bullshit."

"It's not a cult when the God is real, Shade."

"Cadence isn't a God. He's a frequency. He's a weapon system that went rogue."

"Is he?" Timeera leaned her head back against the tank. The green light from the chemlight made her look like a corpse that hadn't realized it was dead yet. "Then explain the sickness."

I stiffened. "What sickness?"

"Don't play dumb. You see it. You smell it." She tapped her chest. "The rot. It started three weeks ago. After the first broadcast. I thought it was radiation. I thought it was a bio-agent. But it's not."

She unzipped her tactical vest. She pulled down the collar of her shirt. "See?"

"Those are nice," I said. The smile forced itself out.

She jiggled herself, "Yeah I knew you were a man of taste. But I wasn't talking about those. Further up."

I leaned forward.

"Oh shit."

Her collarbone was black. Not bruised—*black*. The veins were standing out like cords of obsidian, and the skin around them was translucent, revealing a dark, shifting fluid underneath. It wasn't blood. It was something else. Something alive.

"It resonates," she whispered. "When he sings... it moves. It hurts."

I stared. I felt a cold spike of fear in my gut. I checked my own skin. My dark hands were scarred, calloused, but clean. Timeera was spoiling.

"You're infected." I said.

She took the bottle back from me and drained it.

"I'm dying, Shade. I know that. I just want to die on my own terms. I don't want to turn into... whatever *that* is." She gestured to the algae. "I don't want to be part of the reef."

I looked at the phosphorescence again. It was beautiful, in a sick way. It didn't need the sun. It fed on the dark.

*She's a dead woman walking,* I thought. *She's a liability. I should put a bullet in her head right now. Save the oxygen.*

But I didn't reach for my gun. I reached for my pack. I pulled out a roll of compression tape.

"Give me your leg," I said.

Timeera blinked. She looked at me with those wide, wet eyes, tilting her head. She looked like a **loris** caught in a flashlight beam—slow, confused, and fragile. "What?"

"Your ankle. I saw you favoring it. If you can't walk, we can't get to the marina. You'll slow us down"

Timeera stared at me. A slow, crooked smile spread across her face. It was a ghastly expression, but it was human.

"You're not going to carry me, Key "Shade" Haven."

"No," I agreed. "I'm probably going to use you as a meat shield. But I need you mobile until then. Taiwan is a long swim."

She unlaced her boot, then slipped off her sock. Even with the smell of sweat-wet feet, seeing smoothness of her skin was a glimpse at one of the many things the war had taken from us. She flexed her toes.

"Are you just gonna stare at every part of my body you see, or are you gonna wrap my ankle?"

"I'm gonna wrap your ankle," I gripped it with care and got to work. She closed her eyes, and vocalized a sigh.

"What? Too rough?" I asked.

"No. Just that tough touch, makes me feel better."

Outside, the ocean roared, heavy and waiting.

The path to the marina was paved with dead birds.

Sparrows. Crows. A heron twisted like a pretzel. They littered the asphalt. No blood. Just dead. Dropped from the sky mid-flight.

"Cadence," I whispered. "He's turning up the volume."

Shade didn't answer. He stepped over a crow. He kept moving.

The air hummed. A low vibration. It rattled my teeth. It tickled the rot in my chest. *Thrummm-hummm.* It wasn't just a sound. It was a pressure. Like being at the bottom of a pool.

"Where did they come from?" I asked. "The birds. They're not local."

"Migration," Shade said. "Caught in the net."

"Or they were watching," I said. "And he didn't like what they saw."

I shivered. Not from cold. From the feeling of eyes on my back.

"I don't care that he didn't notice me sucking wind," I thought. "Okay, maybe I did, but only a little."

We reached the edge of the marina. The smell hit us. Sushi bar dumpster fire. Diesel. Dead fish. Me.

The marina was a graveyard. Rusted hulks sat in the mud. Skeletons of industry. The tide was out. Black mud. It sucked at our boots like a needy ex.

We needed a boat. A real one. Not a ferry. Not a trap.

"That one," Shade pointed.

A trawler. Listing to port. Hull scarred. Name painted over. But the radar array was new. Shiny.

"It has power," I said. "I can hear the hum."

"Can you pilot it?"

"Yes."

I lied. I hadn't piloted a trawler in years. But hey. Fake it 'til you make it. Or sink.

We moved. Shadows in the shadows. The mud was slick. I slipped. Shade caught me. His grip was hard. Too fatherly.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Peachy."

Another lie. My vision blurred. Edges gray. Center too sharp. I saw ghosts.

Bonta. Standing by the water. Holding his drone. Smiling like an idiot.

*Kid's toast,* I thought. *I left him. I ran.*

*He told you to run. Hero complex.*

*Liar. You ran because you like breathing. And because you can't keep a kid. You've never been able to.*

I blinked. Bonta was gone. Just a piling. Wood and rot.

"Patrol! Down!" Shade said.

We froze behind a shipping container.

Two guards walked the pier. One American. One Chinese. Walking close. Smoking. The smoke drifted over the water. Tobacco and cloves. Bad cologne.

"The count is wrong," the American said. Young. Tired. "Official report says two hundred. I saw the bodies. It was two thousand."

The Chinese soldier nodded. Flicked his cigarette into the mud.

"Zhè bùshì zhàndòu. Zhè shì túzǎi."

"What did he say?" I whispered.

Shade adjusted his Glassigs, then translated. "This wasn't combat, this was slaughter."

The American laughed. Dry. "Slaughter implies chaos. This wasn't chaos. It was... tidy. They moved in formation. Through the civilians. Like they were sweeping a floor."

"Stabbing unit," the Chinese soldier said. English thick. "You see the wounds? Five punctures. Perfect spacing. No human does that. No human has the stamina."

"Sun," the American said. Name hung in the air. Heavy. Cold. "They say he ascended. They say he's not human anymore."

"If he can do that at one node," the Chinese soldier said, "what happens when he reaches a city?"

They stopped near the trawler. Looked at the water.

"Reminds me of Dili," the Chinese soldier said. "Back in '91. The Santa Cruz massacre. But worse. At least there, they just shot them. Here? The officers walked through the bodies like burial inspectors. No fear. No rush. Just... checking."

"Dili?" the American asked. "Where the hell is that?"

"Just north of Australia. Tiny country, just a spec on the map. Their government uses Facebook as their website and saltwater crocodiles are sacred there."

"Really?"

"Yeah. The country is shaped like one."

The American spat. "Superstitious nonsense."

"Maybe. But the bodies were real. Just like Iheya."

Every thud of my heart rattled my head with hangover force. Damn thing **raced** against my ribs, reflecting my mind. *Thump. Thump. Thump.* Too loud. They'd hear it. They'd hear the rot singing along.

*Shut up,* I told it. *Don't be a diva.*

The rot didn't listen. It pulsed. It hummed. It liked the story. It liked the fear.

The guards turned. Walked back down the pier. Boots crunching on gravel.

"Now," I said.

We moved toward the trawler. We climbed the ladder. The deck was slick.

"Don't shoot!"

A voice. Small. Trembling.

We spun. Shade raised his weapon.

A man and a woman huddled by the wheelhouse. Locals. Old. Weather-beaten. They held fishing knives. Shaking.

"Please," the woman said. "We just want to leave."

"So do we," Shade said. He didn't lower the gun.

"It's our boat," the man said. He stepped in front of the woman. Brave. Stupid. "You can't take it."

"We're not taking it," I said. I stepped forward. I put on my best 'trust me, I'm a professional' smile. It felt brittle. Like cheap plastic. "We're commandeering it. And you're coming with us."

"With you?" The woman looked at Shade. At the gun. At my black veins. "You are... sick."

"I'm delightful," I said. The joke fell flat. Even to me. "And I'm your only ticket out of here. Those soldiers? They're not letting anyone leave. You know that."

The man lowered his knife. He looked at the dead birds on the deck. He looked at the sky.

"The song," he whispered. "It's getting louder."

"Yeah," I said. "Cadence is warming up. So let's not be here for the encore."

I held out my hand.

"Keys."

The man hesitated. Then he tossed them.

I caught them. Cold metal.

"Start the engine," I told Shade. "I'll cast off."

*I'm dying,* I thought. *I'm rotting. And I'm going to die on this fucking mudflat with a guy named Shade.*

*No. You're going to Taiwan. You're going to find the cure.*

*There is no cure. The Handler lied. He played you. "No mistakes this time," he said. "Cute," he said. He knew. He knew I was dead the moment I took the call.*

*So play him back.*

We moved. Looked at the water. The deep, dark water.

It was waiting. And it was hungry.

And somewhere, in the hum, in the dead birds, in the black veins... I felt him watching. Cadence. The Handler. God.

They were all watching. And they were all laughing.

**STATUS:** ACTIVE / COMPROMISED

**[0200 HOURS]**

We've been on the water for hours. But I knew we were followed from Kumejima.

Cadence pursued us through sound. 

My guess was Timeera's condition gave us away. She pilots the vessel to distract herself.

The Engine was a problem. I don't know much about boats or sailing, but excessive black smoke didn't seem like a good sign. 

More disturbing still was the enemy craft didn't increase it's speed to catch up. Once it got within a comfortable distance, it cruised, following as sure as the sun rotated to setting.

It felt more like an escort than pursuit.

But the signal is out there. I can feel it—a pressure in the air, a static charge that makes the hair on my arms stand up. Cadence is sweeping the sectors, looking for a pulse, looking for us.


**[0500 HOURS]**

Yonaguni.

I see the silhouette against the stars—a dark wedge of rock rising from the sea.

We made it. Barely.

The Engine is smoking, and the hull is taking on water. The Signal is still there, but we're in the shadow of the island now. The rocks mask us.

"Beach it," I say.

"What?"

"Beach it. We're sinking anyway."

The old man nods, grim. He aims for a strip of sand between the cliffs.

We hit hard.

The trawler groans as metal shears against rock. We are thrown forward, and I hit the console hard. Darkness takes the edges of my vision.

Silence returns.

I open the door, and the air smells of salt and wet stone.

We arrived on Yonaguni. Cadence isn't far behind.

---

Natural heat feels best, especially from a man you once thought cold. It was like standing close to an open レンジ pleasantly warm with a taste of something good steaming out. 

Scorch lay on his back in the bed, muscles shaped as smooth stones above the blanket. A stray cat hissed and scratch out back, the sky matched the clearness of the sea.

I rolled on top of him, skin on skin. His hardness had me again.

"Nice day. We should spend it here." I kissed him, but his lips stayed flat and dry. The ceiling was a target in his eyes.

"You okay?" I asked.

"Yeah."

"You don't want to again?"

"Naw, I do, I do."

I reached for his member. It wasn't everyday a man like this washed up on my beach. I needed to get my filling while I could. But that part of him was throbbing, while another was somewhere else. He was in two places at once. An impossible thing to be, only the wind could do that.

"There is something. You should tell me, Lock--"

"Don't call me that." 

While the heat coming from his piece withered, I could sense it rising as a summer sun from his chest. This wood house was a fire risk.

"I'm sorry Scorch. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Just talk. Act like I'm not here."

That got his attention. He turned his blaze-gaze on from neck to my scrunched breasts and back up.

"You really tryin' to be here, huh Zima?" He laughed a little. That made me happy like seeing a rainbow.

"Yeah! I can be like a chair. You can ignore me or even sit on me. As long as I'm the only chair in the room, I'm okay."

He gently slid me off with a hard grip. "You funny, girl."

Out of bed he went. He slipped on his military pants and went outside shirtless. So naturally, I put on outside clothes and followed him.

We had been here for days. Or maybe hours. Time had stopped being a line and started being a pool we were floating in.

I watched a tiny green speck navigate the stalk of a beach morning glory near my elbow. A pea aphid. It moved with a single mission, ignoring the giant woman breathing next to it, ignoring the man who burned with a fever that had nothing to do with sickness.

Last two nights had been an embered blur. Sparked by mutual holes we both had. I hadn't thought of my son in hours, but I still felt like my heart was still beating good. As for him, the battle left him as the ferry tracks the horizon. Now the ghost of the fight seemed to posses him again. He viewed the rippling crystal ocean as if it were a mirror.

"You ever see them do it?" Scorch asked. He didn't look at me. He was talking to the water.

"Do what?"

"Drop them." He sat up, sand falling from his shoulders. "The helicopters. They take people—civilians, kids, doesn't matter—and they just... let go."

"I think... why are you thinking that?"

"Becuase they just do it. Zero regard for life. It's all about the show. Like they goin' for style points--who can make the biggest blotch when they watch the red dots explode from above," he said, his voice flat. "Like fireworks. Like a game. To intimidate us. To show us that gravity doesn't give a shit."

He picked up a stone, threw it into the surf. No skillful skip. Only sinking

"My brother would have a quote for that," he muttered. "Something from one of his books. Wilde, maybe. 'We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.' Or maybe he'd say the gutter is where we belong."

The air baked around him. Crabs scattered away. Flies took cover. The sun ducked behind a cloud. I stepped forward and wrapped my arms around him. We could have been a foreign couple in a TV drama. The local island girl meets the handsome Black soldier in a war-beat island. I thought of the poster in my mind.

"You miss them, don't you? Your brothers."

Scorch laughed, a sharp, jagged sound. "Miss them? They left me, Zima. They fucking left me behind. That's what they do. Sun with his plans, Shade with his secrets. They always fuckin' leave. Can't trust the family."

I wanted to stop the tears, but I was too slow. "Yes. You can't trust them to stay as long as you want."

He turned and held me. "Wait-wait, Zima, don't cry. I didn't want to make you cry. What happened to bein' a chair, sheesh? Furniture don't cry."

I grabbed his arms and shook him. "If you'd sat on me back in the bed, we wouldn't be out here!"

He chuckled. "You right."

"Scorch..." My voice got softer than usual, the kind I used for stressed or dying horses. I know it was stupid to feel love so soon. To feel like I wanted him to take me away, that I could take the danger of his fire; face the firing squad or a plunge from a helicopter to see the man I knew he was, even if it meant I had to roast myself to do it. I wanted to tell him. 

"Hmm?"

Why didn't I?

"But for some fucked up reason, dat nigga, my brother won't stop, he don't know how to give up. Family's been fucked since Dad died, but for some insane cause he still comin'. I know he is, Shade. Sun comin' too. I feel it."

He **held his breath and my gaze**, waiting for me to contradict him.

I reached out and touched his arm. His skin was hot, dry. "I believe you. In this place, things just come when they come." *Like you.*

"You don't know him," Scorch whispered. "You don't know what we are."

The ground lurched.

Scorch held me hard. "What the hell?"

This was no earthquake. It was giant land spasm. Like the island was taking a deep breath and expanding.

The pea aphid fell from its leaf.

"What was that?" Scorch's fire balled in his palms with a protective boil.

I looked out at the water. The turquoise surface was churning, boiling white.

"The Monument," I said, the old stories flooding back to me. "It's not supposed to move."

"What isn't?"

"The temple."

"Zima, what are you--holy shit..."

The ocean split. A massive, dark shape tore through the surface, water cascading off its sides like rain off a roof. Stone. Ancient, cut stone. Angles that nature didn't make. Steps that led nowhere.

The Yonaguni Monument wasn't just an underwater ruin anymore.

It was rising.

It towered over us, blocking out the sun, a monolith of wet rock and forgotten history reclaiming its place in the air as if shoveled up by heaven. The sound of the waterfall hit us a second later—a roar that shook the bones in my chest.

Scorch stared at it with nothing to say.

"Well shit. That's not supposed to move right?"

I shook my head. It was like all thought emptied out except for us standing in the sand being looked down on by the alien temple that was supposed to be underwater.

"I guess we're not the only ones waking up."

I looked at the massive structure, dripping and imposing, and I felt sick. Scorch was the only support I had, so I clung to him.

"No," I said. "We're not."

And I knew, with the certainty of a mother who has already lost everything, that the peace was over. War found us.

Now came the real test of love.
