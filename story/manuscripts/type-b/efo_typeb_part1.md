# Prologue

## [Archivist’s Note](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1HDS4p5nXX6bqnTdXx5beemVPnprqIaAEOvDNx6ZEvDM/edit)

I knew before I saw the signature that this would be his final act. At the foot of a witness statement, the 4-letter mark was there. His tiny scribbled name, discreet, unflourished. A reminder that dad had held this paper, sat over it, thought about it. This made my spine curve like a withering tree branch.

This damned record— a sandy pit with an antlion lying in ambush— is what he died for? By viewing its contents, I'd already begun the slow slide down. The greedy fine grains shifted beneath me. I was in the insectary now, watching the snap-limbed bugs writhe through glass, dismemberment on full display. At first I couldn't believe I'd have to stick my hands in there. I stared for a while, arms at my sides, just feeling my pulse flexing at my neck with black-night highway speed worry.

But after a team of suits deposited two small truckloads of files into my study, I knew. The musty moats of dust swirled like flies over a cadaver. Everything smelled aged and alien. It had been there. In Okinawa. That dank island air was corrosive perfume, inhabiting anything that stayed within its perimeter for too long.

Years of fighting bureaucracy and it was finally here.

Yet, even after running my finger over the top box’s beaten sides, it still felt far away. The sun-scratched U.S. Space Force insignia, peeled chain of custody stickers, fingertip sweat smears— so many hands had held the boxes without understanding why they existed at all.

If I ever step foot on those shores, I would know it by the lingering scent of storied decay floating everywhere. I'm starting to understand why Dad never talked about it.

Secret. That's how his feelings were classified. One stabbing pump of my heart forced me to recall how avoidant he always was.

After I'd signed several release forms, the team of dark-suited deliverymen began filing out. The man in charge lingered, looking up to me (under average height), pores oozing greasy sleep debt on his face. He glanced at the boxes, then back at me.

"You sure you want to handle this alone, ma'am?" His neutral American accented voice carried concerned warning. "We can leave a team to help catalog—"

"I'm sure." I slipped my pen over the last form’s signature line. No direct look at him.

"It's just... your father's estate specifically requested you. By name. Most family members, they'd take one look at a haul like this and—"

"I'm not most family members. I'm the only family member… for now."

"No ma'am, I suppose not." His expression turned gloomy, resigned. He blew his peanut butter sandwich breath out hard then said, "Well I'm just sayin’, for nearly half a century, these files have occupied a single room in some hardly acknowledged U.S. military storage facility. Few ventured in there, and when they did, they signed their log, then quick-stepped out. That's what I heard. It's like they’re cancer-causing or cursed, or both."

"I understand."

He looked as if he wanted to say more. Or to try and protect me, this small tired Asian woman, from the creatures in the boxes. He had the eyes of a half-time hero.

"I'll be going then. Sorry for your loss and good luck with it."

"Thank you."

I shut the door. Then heard a slide by the wall. The wall of cartons was a portrait with traveling eyes.  
Or was it something else? I suspected so. It wasn't only the droopy sight of the boxes that spurt liquid dread through me. The way they slanted— exhausted, defeated— triggered micro-shifting groans from their lids. Not every few minutes. Constantly. A low chorus of cardboard stress and settling weight, like joints popping in an empty house. I tried to tell myself it was normal. Boxes settle. But boxes don't breathe.

Whatever language spoke through those disembodied creases stayed indecipherable— but made me whip my head up in watchful paranoia. Every few minutes. Every \*tap\*. Every \*crack\*. Sometimes when I was certain I'd been facing the window, I'd turn to find a box had shifted orientation. Corners now pointed at my desk. Lids slightly more ajar.

As much as I didn't want to admit it, staring at the shoulder-high wall of sagging containers, there was a force emanating from them. Not metaphorical— physical. It steamed out subtly at first, like exhaust over asphalt on a balmy summer afternoon. Then it intensified. The air near the boxes had weight. As if the space itself had been compressed and now wanted to expand into my lungs. I breathed shallowly. Despite the climatized blow of air pushing wisps of my hair under the vents, the side of my body warmed when I passed by.

My back flexed and arms shook when I lifted the first one down and pulled out the first file— a folder goblin with papers hanging out of the folds, like an overstuffed laundry hamper reeking and half-dry.  
When I lifted the lid fully, the smell hit first— not mildew, though that was there. Other smells puffed out. Copper, salt and another hard to name. Whatever it was made my hindbrain scream *meat* even though these were only papers. 

The first file folder was damp to the touch, defying the room’s refrigerator dry cold. My fingertips came away clean, but I rubbed them together anyway, expecting residue that wasn't there.  
Pulse jamming in my ears, I cleared my throat and sat. Adjusted my jacket. Sip of water— ritual, not thirst. I smoothed the first folder flat with both palms. Once. Twice. Three times. Only then could I read it.

As I pulled the first document free, I noticed something I hadn't seen in the initial inspection. In the margin of a transmission log, someone had written in pencil: \*They're listening. Even now.\* The handwriting wasn't my father's.

I didn't know yet if that made it better or worse. But I was ready.

Prepared to spend as long as necessary digging through fear and falsity, to learn what my father had become in that place.

To discover what followed him home and killed him.

## Arrested Silence (Higa Bonta \- 比嘉ボンタ)

I find myself marooned on a corpse-island. Egad\! Even bugs are acting up. Even the flies balled into clusters behind me (kinda like floating mochi) as I sat fishing early this morning. The port was a phone with no notifications— sound was muted but 変な things crept at my back.

On the walk down things were odd. The tapping of my house key against my small water flask connected to my belt clanked dull as an old bell with each step. That got my ear for a block. First it was the sky: how the clouds oozed rusty dawn in an inverted pyramid— that was the first bad sign.

Then it was the noise. Why bring it up? Since there was scant to be heard, is why. While Awase Port can be quiet, this was a mean silence.  The type that comes before an *ambuscade* (finally got to use this word\!) like in Fortnight and an enemy dancing, or tea-bagging over your grave. And the sounds I did hear were awkward, no cap: vending-truck jingles cut mid-note— not trailing off, but *erased*, like someone  muted it, a sawtoothing scooter clapped then ripped at a corner, obaa’s antique Enka radio coughed out an intro to a song I didn’t know, then went to radio snow. I didn’t know ears could strain like eyes do trying to hear. This must be what it’s like to get old (I’ve heard all the wax builds up). It’s like all sound was password protected and one by one, the owners forgot the secret code. Everybody got locked out. (Strange\!)

I reached my spot and soundlessness came back. Funny quiet. マジで nothing stirred. Frozen were trees. Frozen were cicadas. Frozen were waves. Water like a clean window after wiping, spotless— impossiblly clean. Time took a break this morning, only resuming work as I sat with my rod out in the water. Took me a while to breathe normally after seeing that.

Mom had told me not to come out today. And said if I did to take my sister with me. But I couldn’t be bothered. She takes crikey forever ほんとぅぅに for-e-ver to get up and get ready. When I set out at 0530, I heard her light snores and smelled her さば-stink sleep from her futon. By the time I got back, in an hour, she’d still be sleep. Likely.

Forty-five minutes passed. Nothing bit. My rod stayed useless, a toy floating the tide. Real lame\! So I packed up to head home. At this point, the happy blue of the sky was well over the sad hue of the ocean. That damnable heat made my forehead shimmer.

On the way back, the lack of normal *acustics* made me walk faster. So I did. Outside the 7/11, two elder whispered. "Ships," one mumbled. "Foreign ships westward near Itoman." 

I heard something about *beasts* walking ashore— half-men, half-shadows like Moreau’s own vivisected creatures. Was this a joke? The other murmured, "heard the ships were empty. Coffins without crew." 

ヤバイ\! Who can say? Mom calls it *gajimaru* gossip. Says it's harmless, but still keeps her distance from those old guys. "They talk too much nonsense." She said that with worry last week. I dreamed of ghosts after that. Ones ferrying me off to far away shores, to a place I shouldn’t, yet needed to be. Wouldn’t that be something\!

Trudging home I looked up. The clouds— still in that inverted pyramid. Still pointing west. Yomitan? Chatan?

The shape hadn't moved in over an hour or two.

Clouds don't do that, and cities make sounds.

I went back to my ebook and ate a bento lunch. Meio is still sleep.

## Brothers in the Battlefield 

To let go of lagom is to see a red arm half-attached; it clings to God’s law of bloodletting.

That idea came to me after another body smashed into the sand facedown. Mouth open, hard sand dried his tongue further. Another death at my hand.

"Bro\! You gonna paint a picture\!? Get yo ass over here and get low\!"

I ducked and dashed over to join my younger brother. Under the beating sun, Scorch’s face was blacker than back home; his scraggled low beard had specks of coral in it. Spit came out when he said, "Good, good nigga you made it. Was worried a little there."

The two of us hunched behind a portable barricade. Another bomb, two, then three exploded across the beach. From where I knelt, this Siege Smart Shield appeared thin. The pinging of enemy fire on the other side made me wonder if it would maintain integrity.

Between heavy breaths I said, "You didn't think I'd make it?"

"Of course yo bigorexia black ass was gonna make it. Im more concerned about that shooter in the brush and if Sun can keep up. All dat pilates he do ain't no good here."

A surge of scared made my arm tingle. I shook it to return the feeling. The grip of my rifle grounded me.

"It’s good for balance and strength."

He rolled his eyes. "Pot shot bonus. Gimme the weights any day."

"Last weight you saw was in line at the \[REDACTED\] last chow."

"Ha. Ha. You ain’t funny."

I signaled quiet, surprised it actually worked for once. From the staticky radio came Sun’s voice.

"Y’all read?"

"I do," I said. I glanced at Scorch. He had been examining his rifle like an art piece. Then had moved on to staring at the unkept greenery to our right on the beach, no doubt envisioning how he would make it more orderly— control it. Or he was attempting to place the enemy unit that had been haunting us since we’d heard the first order. I gave him a shove.

"What\!?" he jolted.

I made three sharp taps at my ear. His annoyance took 40 seconds longer than I liked to fade, but he grudged stiffness, he switched his radio on and pressed his earpiece deeper into his thick skull.

"Oh, go ahead. We’re good. Go Sun."

"Unit completed recon up \_\_\_."

"Nigga where you at?" Scorch duck-walked closer. Two more pings of the barrier sounded just as he stopped. He dropped his head lower at the same time that I did.

"I’m up the beach on the sea side, dug in. They won’t find me."

"Cool. What do you see?"

"Enemy has approximately 5 units, and two shooters are on the jungle side."

"We knew that already. Son-of-a-bitch spot was pinned out here. Did you find out anything ACTUALLY useful?"

I punched Scorch in the arm and shook my head. He returned a flash of mocking laughter.

"Put your see-through lenses on," Sun sounded as if he were gritting his teeth. I knew he was holding back unleashing a scalding return to our youngest brother.

We hurried to put the gear on, intact and unzipping them. They still had that sleep-preserved smell of simplicity, manufactured item.  
"These things never work," I complained.

"Biggest waste of fuckin’ coin on these pieces," Scorch.

\[BEGIN BATTLE SEQUENCE\]

\[DRONE SHOT – Overhead Recon Feed\]  
The beach stretched out like a scar—cratered sand, smoke curling into broken-finger columns, the surf dragging bodies and wreckage back and forth. Wind gusted hard enough to scatter grit into the haze. Sunlight filtered pale through scattered clouds. Fuel reeked on the air, sharp enough to sting. The view was not serene.

\[SHADE’S ACCOUNT\]  
The next barrage took down our cover. The Smart Shield cracked, hummed, and collapsed with a pathetic whine. I spat grit, muttered, "Piece of shit government dollars."

"Don’t matter now," Scorch barked, already lifting his rifle. "Time to go hot." His shot hit clean through the brush. The wet slap echoed back. "Haircut."

Another explosion rattled the barricade. The beach opened on us.

\[SUN – Audio Overlay\]  
"You’re Overexposed. Don’t Dare a Dare." His voice snapped through the comms, clipped and tight.

Scorch cursed, "Just ’cause you get Overexposed fast don’t mean I do\!"

"Shut the fuck up. Eyes forward," I cut in, sliding beside him.

"Yeah, yeah," he grumbled, "you don’t gotta tell me twice."

\[DRONE SHOT – Low Sweep\]  
Enemy fire streaked across the dunes. Two signatures pinned their sights on our coordinates.

\[SHADE’S ACCOUNT\]  
Scorch wiped grit from his cheek where a round had grazed him. He growled, "Fuck that—I’m Daring."

He slammed his rifle into mine, magnetic coupler sparking. Shared mag locked. The barrels flared white-hot, muzzle flash stretching longer than it had any right to. Heat shimmered between us. Dare Called: Overheat Volley. His Energy spiked, his Exposure screamed red across the HUD.

I cursed, blurred into Ghost Step, my body jerking sharp as the Dare drained me. Enemy fire tracked instantly. We rolled and spat rounds back. It was not a graceful maneuver.

Scorch’s weapon jammed. Enemy scope found him in that instant. I dove, smashed him sideways into the sand.

"That would’ve been a D-rank death," I snapped.

He coughed grit, then smirked bitter: "Ranking don’t matter if I’m already smoking."

We split, trying to flank. I circled left, he pushed right. Gunfire shredded the brush. The jungle seethed like it was alive. The plan was not flawless.

\[DRONE SHOT – New Contact Detected\]  
A mechanical shriek cut through the wind. Hover-signature appeared: air bike, fifteen feet off the ground, rider armored, weapon mounted.

\[SHADE’S ACCOUNT\]  
"This ain’t what I signed up for\!" I shouted.

Scorch barked back, "Aim for the fans\! Drop the bastard\!" He fired, but the rounds pinged harmless off reinforced plating. The rider strafed us with heavier fire, pinning us into the sand.

\[SUN – Entry Recorded\]  
Sun broke cover at last, calm and steady. Dare Called: Precision Command. His Energy burned steady, but already his Exposure climbed fast. His voice cut the chaos into lanes. "On me. Triangle."

We locked in. Scorch blazing, me darting in, Sun calling strikes. The rider tore the surf into blood-mist spray.

\[DRONE SHOT – Mid-Engagement\]  
Exposure meters spiked in tandem. Shade \+ Scorch attempted Dual Dare Sync. Rounds staggered in rhythm. The outcome was not guaranteed. Sync slipped. Dare failed.

\[SHADE’S ACCOUNT\]  
The rider pressed the advantage, shredding the sand in lines.

Then Sun’s voice: "Together. Now."

We didn’t hesitate. Triple Dare Called: Daybreak Trinity. Weapons locked in sequence. Energy surged, Exposure maxed, HUD glitching like the world itself cracked. Time stuttered. The air warped.

All three volleys converged. The air bike ripped apart mid-scream, the rider crumpling into smoke.

\[DRONE SHOT – Closing Image\]  
Three heat signatures stood amid smoke and ruin, panting, Overexposed, half-spent.

\[SHADE’S ACCOUNT\]  
The treeline shifted though the wind had stopped. I spat grit, shook my head. "This fight ain’t over."

\[AFTER THE BATTLE SEQUENCE AND THE BROTHERS ARE REUNITED\]

Alone a single tree multiplies, stretches, and shrinks to police line up heights. Together they form a barrier of tropical terror. 

"Damn." Scorch stared forestward.

"What’s over there?" I joined him while, behind me, Sun was hot-focused on his tablet, probably mapping out our next moves.

"You don’t feel that?"

"Feel what?"

"Wind’s pickin’ up. Came outta nowhere. And somethin’ back there don’t seem too happy about what we did."

Late afternoon brightness was buried behind clouds, yet even with less visibility I saw what he was talking about. Sensed it too.

Where the beach met the brambled bush, the jungle swung to some unseen rhythm, first with the low whip of branches, then with the prick of dried stickiness along my neck, then with the dank reek of the woods carried seaward into the corpse-chomping surf, until even the thin trunks— unarmleted, stripped bare— bent as though they might break under the sudden invisible push.

"Don’t You Feel That?" I heard Scorch say again.

"Feel What?"

"Wind Picked Up."

"Foo you just said that. What the fuck." I shot back.

"Shade, you say somethin’?" Scorch gave me a rare genuinely curious look.

"I said ‘what the fuck’."

"Oh oh, I thought I heard your voice from over there." He gestured at the treeline where the enemy had been. A choral formation of trees muttering some song of worship to ungodly union. They stared right at us. I didn’t want to look at it anymore.

"Scorch… c’mon." I tugged at his arm, but he kept seeing over there.

"Shade?"

"Yeah?"

"Dis place is fucked. We gotta get off. Go home." He thumbed the chain on his chest. Signal of vow he acknowledged too late. That’s all I knew.

"We will. We’re gonna do it bro."

"If they let us."

He never took his eyes off the trees. 

## Archivist's Dictated Note: Review of field footage obtained from a helmet-mounter camera (presumably Shade’s)

Present the grainy picture are Scorch and Shade. Both are seated on their loaded packs. Two black in color lumps, hardly visible due to the time of day. Dusk is dimming in the sky. Trees rustling their schff-schff sound and small waves coming the shore are audible in front of their small fire.

Begin review at 2356:

"Hey nigga, did you see me get fat one in the brush?"

"Yeah."

"Why you sound so, so unenthused?"

"Huh? I was? My bad, didn't mean to."

"Man NVM. See this why I don't be sayin’ nuthin’ to you ass."

"Because why? You celebratin’ a kill like damn Afghan terrorist?"

"See\! See\! My nigga why. So. Serious?"

\[Scorch stands and shoves him\]

"Ah ha you Joker now?"

\[Shade shoves him back. Scorch steps back.\]

"Naw, but for real, you don't be listenin’. Always got yo head somewhere else. It's like ain't nuthin' get through."

"Eat ploor."

"Ah OOH HAHA I remember dat one from the old Batman."

"I thought you would."

\[Shade reaches under him, unzips his ruck, and pulls out two items.\]

\[There’s trebled fizz, followed by the signal popping of radio communication.\]

\[Scorch finds his pack and sits, still looking past, almost through Shade.\]

"And you talk about me not payin’ attention."

"Wha-whatt’d I do?"

"Yo ass looking at them trees again. What’s there?"

"Naw foo it's nuthin’... (that shit just like last night)."

"Huh? You mumble somethin over there?"

"Not a damn thing. You eatin’?"

\[Shade tossed a paperbag-toned ration at Scorch. He almost lets it drop, but catches it.\]

"You are too. C’mon."

"Let's see what we got here… pasta, oh okay day ain't bad. What you got?"

"Sloppy Joe."

"Uhhuu you gonna get dem's slop shit+farts again. Hahaha."

"Man nigga shut up." \[Shade goes to slap his head. Scorch dodges.\]

"My evasion too fast."

"It was barely fast enough during that Dare. Why'd you go for it? You burned one, so I had to burn, then Sun had to step in."

"Foo\! I already been told you Black ass twice, that one in the bush had a lock on us. Way too hard to bait out anyway. And then there was… there was—"

"There was what?"

\[They look at each other for a while. Rare to see them quiet. Their shadows slant and enlarge behind them. The camera pics up a low voice humming mid-song.\]

"Aw nvm, you wouldn't understand."

"Okay."

\[Quieter now. Amid the island ambience, I hear them chewing like cows, and that humming coming from off-screen. I can't place the song.\]

"It's so weird," Shade says.

"You gotta be more specific. Lots of weird shit going on here."

"Well there's the obvious shit: the war, Okinawa, soldiers of various ethnicities coming at us. They're not all Chinese. You saw?"

\[Scorch gulps down some water.\]

"Yeah I noticed."

"Yeah. But I meant it's weird how Sun just left this tablet while he went to do a perimeter check. I mean how long does it take to go around a 30 foot perimeter."

\[Scorch shakes his head.\]

"Dat nigga weird. Add him to the list."

"Imma add yo ass to this list." 

\[Shade reaches to slap him. Scorch slaps his head first. Shade dodges.\]

"Your speed stat got slow on."

"Whatever."

\[Shade picks up the radio.\]

"Yo Sun, what's good?"

"Fine. Was just listening to an old song."

"While on perimeter check?"

"I secured the perimeter twenty minutes ago."

"Oh."

"Y'all eatin?"

"Yeah, yeah. Got one for you."

"Good. Thought I smelled it. My mouth’s watering."

"I'll heat it up for you."

"Cool. I'm going back."

\[The radio clicks off. The humming continues, louder now. \*Thrummm-hummm-thrummm.\* Shade fumbles with Sun's ration packet, hands visibly trembling. Drops it twice before getting it open.\]

"You good?" Scorch asks, but he's not looking at Shade. Still watching the trees.

"Yeah. Dare burnout. You feel it?"

"Nah. I'm straight."

\[Scorch's hands are steady as he shovels pasta into his mouth. No visible tremor despite his Exposure readings having maxed during the triple Dare.\]

"It's so weird," Shade says again.

\[Scorch doesn't respond. Just chews. The firelight makes his face strange—half-shadow, half-orange glow. His eyes don't track with the conversation.\]

\[0031:45 \- Sun returns. Sits across from them. Sets the tablet between his knees, screen glowing blue-white. His fingers move across it: \*tap-tap-tap, swipe, tap.\* He doesn't make eye contact with either brother.\]

"Sun, bro, you gonna eat?"

"Mhm."

\[Sun doesn't reach for the heated ration. Keeps working the tablet. The humming gets quieter. Shade's breathing audible now—faster, shallower. \*Thump-thump-thump\* picks up on the camera's audio.\]

"Yo, this occupation shit is insane," Scorch says suddenly. His usual cadence starts strong but dies halfway through. "Like, okay the Chinese here, fine. But you feel it? That other thing?"

\[Shade leans forward slightly. Camera angle shifts with the movement.\]

"What other thing?"

"The presence. Like something's using the Chinese as cover, but it's watching from deeper. It's in the trees, the water, the air. It's in—" 

\[Scorch touches his chest, fingers pressing against his sternum.\] 

"—it's closer than it should be."

\[The fire \*crackles-pops\*, sends sparks into the dark. \*Ssssssss-crack.\* Shade's posture tightens—shoulders up, head forward.\]

"You sound paranoid."

"I sound right."

\[Sun's fingers stop. He looks up for the first time since sitting down. His gaze is direct, unblinking.\]

"He's not wrong," Sun says. "This island is occupied in more than one sense. Layers of control. The Chinese are the outer layer."

"And what's the inner layer?"

\[Sun tilts his head quizzically. A long pause— approximately 4 seconds— before responding. His expression is neutral, almost serene.\]

"Do you remember when we were kids? Building that Lego town in the old Lakeside house?"

\[Shade's head jerks slightly. Visible confusion in his posture. Scorch stops chewing mid-bite.\]

"Yeah," Shade says carefully. "We spent like, what, two months on it?"

"Two months and six days." \[Sun's voice is soft but measured.\] "We built it block by block. Every building, every street, every little park bench. We thought we were gods of that world."

\[Scorch laughs—short, sounds more like a cough than genuine amusement.\] 

"Man, I remember. I kept trying to add the Batcave and y'all kept saying it didn't fit the aesthetic."

"You still put it in the sewer system," Shade adds. \[His shoulders drop slightly. A flicker of warmth crosses his face—a half-smile that reaches his eyes for the first time since the recording began.\] "We found it like a week later."

\[For approximately 6 seconds, all three are smiling. Scorch nods, Shade's posture relaxes, Sun's expression softens. The fire warms. The jungle ambience quiets.\]

"Then Dad came down," Sun says.

\[Both smiles disappear instantly. Scorch's jaw clenches. Shade's back goes rigid.\]

"He didn't mean to step on it," Shade says quickly. His hands grip his knees. "He was looking for tools, he—"

"He crushed the town hall," Sun interrupts. \[His face shows no emotion.\] "The library. Half the residential district. We spent weeks on that, and in two seconds, it was rubble."

\[Scorch sets his ration down with more force than necessary. \*Thunk.\* Stares at the ground between his feet.\]

"The point," Sun continues, eyes back on the tablet, "\*is that we were builders. Small builders. And something larger walked through our world without even noticing. That's what's happening here. The Chinese, this presence Scorch feels—they're walking through \*our\* world. Crushing what we build."

\[Shade's hands form fists on his knees. His breathing changes—shorter, harder through his nose. Jaw muscles flex.\]

"So what," Shade says. \[Voice tight, clipped.\] "We just let them?"

\[Sun looks up. The firelight reflects in his eyes—bright, unnatural. He holds Shade's gaze for an extended moment without blinking.\]

"No. We become something they \*can't\* walk through. A force of comparable size. Comparable capability."

"You don't mean armies," Shade says. \[His voice is quieter now. Wary.\]

"No. I don't."

\[The humming returns. Louder. \*Thrummmmm-hummmmm.\* The camera's audio distorts slightly—a digital warble overlaying the sound.\]

"What you mean then?" \[Scorch's voice is higher pitched than usual. Almost childlike. He's staring at Sun with his head tilted, like trying to recognize someone from a distance.\]

\[Sun doesn't answer. Returns to the tablet. \*Tap-tap-swipe.\* His face is illuminated by the blue glow, features cast in sharp relief.\]

\[Shade opens his mouth. Closes it. Opens it again.\] 

"Dad would've—"

\[Scorch's entire body goes still. His face hardens—eyes flat, mouth a thin line. Sun doesn't look up. Doesn't stop working the tablet.\]

"—Dad would've told us to stick together. No matter what."

\[Silence. The fire \*hisses-spits.\* Wind moves through the clearing—or something else. \*Whoooosh-tap-tap-tap.\* Tree branches visible at the edge of frame sway though no breeze touches the flames.\]

"Dad's not here," Sun says finally. \[No inflection. Statement of fact.\] "And maybe that's the point."

\[Shade's shoulders slump. He looks down at his hands—still shaking—then at Scorch, then at Sun. His mouth opens as if to speak but nothing comes out. He swallows hard. Visible.\]

\[They eat in silence. The chewing sounds are amplified in the quiet: \*smack-chomp-smack, gulp, smack-chomp-smack.\* The humming weaves between their breaths—three distinct rhythms that don't quite sync.\]

\[Archivist's Note: At timestamp 0042:17, there is an audio anomaly. The humming stops abruptly. In the silence, three distinct breathing patterns are audible: Shade's (rapid, shallow), Scorch's (steady but occasionally hitching), and a third—thin, mechanical, emanating from the tablet's speaker. Sun had not spoken for approximately 90 seconds when this was recorded.\]

\[0042:19 \- Scorch suddenly stands. Points at the treeline with his whole arm extended, finger shaking.\]

"Yo. You hear that?"

"Hear what?" \[Shade's head whips toward where Scorch is pointing. Squints into the darkness.\]

"That voice. It's—" \[Scorch stops. Blinks rapidly three times.\] "Nah. Nvm."

"What voice?"

\[Scorch looks at Shade. Then his eyes drift past, unfocused, like looking through him at something behind.\]

"Your voice. Coming from the trees. You said... you said 'Foo you just said that. What the fuck.'"

\[Shade's entire body goes rigid. His eyes widen. Those were his exact words from approximately 23 minutes earlier at the post-battle treeline.\]

"I didn't say anything just now."

"I know. But I heard you."

\[The fire pops—\*CRACK-snap-hisssss.\* Sun's tablet screen flickers. For 2-3 frames, the reflection on Sun's face changes—the blue glow shifts to orange-red, highlights his features in a way that makes the shadows look burned, textured. Then normal blue light returns.\]

\[Sun stands, tucks the tablet under his arm. His movements are deliberate, controlled.\]

"We should sleep in shifts. I'll take first watch."

"Sun—" \[Shade half-rises, one hand extended.\]

"Rest. We move at 0600."

\[Sun walks to the edge of the clearing. Stands with his back to them, silhouetted against the darker jungle. The humming resumes—and the rhythm matches the rise and fall of Sun's shoulders as he breathes.\]

\[Scorch lies down quickly, pulls his knees to his chest. His eyes stay open, fixed on the fire. Doesn't blink for over a minute.\]

\[Shade remains seated between where his brothers are positioned. He looks left at Scorch. Right at Sun's back. Down at his still-shaking hands. His chest rises and falls—deep breath, hold, slow exhale. Trying to steady himself. It doesn't work.\]

\[0048:33 \- The last clear image before the timestamp cuts: the fire casting three shadows against the bunker wall. Two shadows are stationary—one curled (Scorch), one sitting upright (Shade). The third shadow—tall, standing at the clearing's edge—elongates and contracts in a rhythm that doesn't match the fire's movement. Sun's physical body remains perfectly still, but his shadow shifts. Grows. Shrinks. Grows again.\]

\[0048:37 \- Feed corruption. Audio continues for 4 more seconds: the humming, three sets of breathing (two human, one mechanical), and a sound like \*click-whirr-click\*—possibly the tablet, possibly something else.\]

\[0048:41 \- Recording ends.\]

\---

\*\*\[Archivist's Note \- Addendum\]:\*\*

This was the last footage recovered from Shade's helmet-mounted camera before the unit proceeded to Node 1 (Zamami Island). The three brothers were never recorded together in a single frame again. 

Subsequent mission logs reference "communication difficulties" and "unit cohesion concerns" but provide no detail. When questioned during debriefing (prior to his disappearance), Shade described this evening as "the last time we were in the same room but not in the same world."

The audio anomaly at 0042:17 has been analyzed by three separate technical teams. None can identify the source of the third breathing pattern. The tablet recovered from Sun's effects (see Evidence Log CLEF-7) contained no audio recording features and should not have been capable of producing the sound captured on this recording.

The shadow distortion visible at timestamp 0048:33 is likely a compression artifact. Likely.

## Shade \- Disappearance

The morning sun greeted my eyes, but only the sound of nature made itself known. Tree fronds, high and swishing, wind breezing to a blow, the sawing buzz of insects all pressed around me. But voices were missing. So were the disparate pops of discharging small arms. 

That wasn't the most disturbing part. Worse was that they'd been right there, at angles around me some time before dawn. But now all that remained where their sleep mats had been were moist dirt divots, outlines of their forms.

I searched around. Through the spines of jungle, my sweat-blistered feet chafed, cuts dragged across my forearms, but there was nothing.

Panic began to tear at my nerves at the possibilities: taken? captured? or killed?

I slapped my face, and forced it to quit the near crying contours. No bodies, no blood. "They're alive. They're alive." In this hell, I forced myself to believe it.

The morning now made itself known with its burning blades stabbing through the vegetation, and each lance of light thrust despair forward in my mind. I felt as if in the jaws of a great monster, prepared to be good for the day. Paranoid thoughts surveilled me as I circled the camp, and on the fourth spiral around I saw them. Two sets of uncovered footprints, headed in opposing directions.

## Scorch

This has got to be it. The right way. But the sun’s fuckin’ with my head so I got turned around a few times before gettin’ outta that godawful jungle.

There’s streets, shops, even people here (like normal). The battle is waay behind me, I think… What the fuck was that? Looked like that old man flashed a knife, somethin’ there in the waistband, ready to pull up. But no no, it’s just the sun’s gleam. That’s all, nothin’ to freak about.

The way these niggas look at me… goddamn it, it’s disturbing. Might as well be an alien here, from another planet. Can’t believe I signed up for this. The bag wasn’t bad, true. Being with the brothers was a decent bonus, but like always, they’re gone again. Could never rely on em’ somethings never change.

But fuck it, I’m good. I got me. Got the gun and deez cocoa-colored nuts. That’s all I need.

Wait. All uh-sudden I gotta shit. BAD. No worse… throw up.

I pull over to some fly-infested grass patch and let it out. It’s all green and brown mush from the pit of my gut and smells like the bathroom at the club at 3AM, all backed-up johns, smoky and shitty.

When I look up, that same ol’ man is lurkin’ again. Here he come. But his face is friendlier. He learned. Bout time. Now he callin’ me over, looks like he wants to help. Got hands behind his back but I ain’t scared. Got the gun, remember?

Next thing I know he’s leadin’ me toward a boat. Probably wanna show me his fish or something. I ask him if he seen two other Black folk, soldiers like me, he nods and beckons at the boat again. He’s dat’ nigga in the game waitin’ on you to press ‘A’ to get on.

But hold up—his lips moved when I asked. Did he answer? Couldn’t hear no words. Just a buzzing. Like TV static. Or maybe that’s my ears.

I feel more eyes on me, but ain’t nuthin’ new. Reflections stacked in glass windows. Scooters idling longer than they should. A woman with an umbrella staring too long. Maybe they all know. Maybe they all been watchin’.

I touch the metal behind my shirt—still there like always. They said he’d be on an island, the target. But mufucka didn’t tell which one. Why the military be ass like that sometimes?

Now my ass got bubbleguts. That combined with swampass in this heat is enough to sit man down for good minute. But not me. I finally press ‘A’.

The boat’s small but stable. Missing brothers, enemy-at-large, this horrible heat, war in my belching stomach and all around, that’s four problems too many for today.

And here’s the thing: I can talk. Always could. Talk my way into a party, talk my way outta cuffs, talk my way to a free drink when the night was dry. My mouth’s the real weapon, not this rusty piece. I could talk my way into God’s own good graces if I had to.

So I test it. Try to talk the old man. Ask him what he’s hiding behind his back. Ask him where he’s taking me. Ask him—ask him something.

He smiles, keeps walking. No answer. Just that hum again, louder this time. Flies buzzing, or maybe his throat working like a radio on the wrong channel.

I swallow hard. My voice don’t stick like it used to.

But nah. I’m good. I’m always good.

## Burned on the Beach (Bonta)

I’d been told to stay away from the beaches. These days, even the skies aren’t safe, that’s what 母親 said. Merciful heavens, even the skies\!

But today was unavoidable. The madness of the fire that scorched me still has me crying. But Meio was crying harder, so I suppose there’s nothing more I can complain for.

Mom had gone to do her business and told me to watch my little sister. This meant entertaining her as if she were a barking, sniffing 子犬, except there was no mess to clean up after her. 

"Big brother\! What are you doing?" Meio called. "Come over and help dig this up."

"In a minute." I was fixated by the horizon. I extended my arm to a point to count boats. "One… two…" I got to ten before I lost count. On the Awase side the floating masses were all fishing rigs, some small, others more robust. But here, they were war machines. ヤバイ\! Rumors on the radio were true\! This is what they called a "blockade" I thought. But I couldn’t put my finger on why.

Under a bright sky, choppy seas stuttered before me at the water’s expanse. Some wind tousled my hair and a jet’s cry overhead stuffed out my hearing for a spell. 

The slip of a second was the beginning of a new terror.

"Meio?"

I turned slowly. Yet the only thing that greeted me was a plastic pink pale and kiwi green shovel sworded into the sand. Her small footprints led back to the pirate ship.

"Meio? Where’d you go? You shouldn’t go so far."

My heart began pumping from the adventure afoot. I felt as if I were Prendick first glimpsing Moreau’s isle of Beast-freaks. I leaned in and began to track her.

The pirate ship was always one of my favorite features of this beach. I imagined it running the rough waters, tossed here and there along the unforgiving waves of the Pacific, her pursued crew, desperate, then marooned here, long before Chatan-町 had grown to encircle it. What fantasy\! I thought of this as I weaved through the plastic hold, climbed the ladder to the crow’s nest and surveyed the area. That’s when the sharp realization made my heart thunder with a new piercing gallop.

Meio is missing. My heart clattered, my skin prickled, my voice shriveled into sand.

"Meio\! This isn’t funny come out\!"

At that point, movement on the beach caught my eye. One of the boats, a smaller but still hardy vessel, had moved near the shore during my search. 怖い\! I immediately ducked. My breath came in quick wheezes. Something told me not to be found. But where was Meio? The situation went south fast. As silent as possible, I lowered myself to the main deck and concealed myself again.

Convinced I couldn’t be seen, I peak out over the edge of the ship. Across the between, where no more than ten minutes prior I’d been standing, a group of men had gathered.   
I pointed my finger and made tiny pokes at air, counting. Perhaps there were a dozen. I heard one, a Black guy with a craggly white and black beard shout and gesture around, then the others fanned out along the area. They were passing right by the ship\!

My heart jammed my throat. Stomach pressed flat, chest thumped, sweat ticked down my ear. Gadzooks — even my own breath threatened to expose me to these soldiers of unknown allegiance or intention.

For some time I waited, until the sandy footsteps fell away. When I got up there were only three men left by the boat. One was covered in a thick, tarp-like hood, the other was the 黒人 who gave the orders, and another appeared Chinese, but gripped the wrist of a little girl.

Meio\!

"Found her over by the basketball court bathrooms," he said. He thrust her forward toward the hooded man.

"This is no place for children. Not anymore," the black guy said, "what should we do with her C-1? She might tattle."

"No, no I-I won’t tell. I’ll be good," Meio’s slight frame rattled.

The hooded man stepped forward. "There are few child subjects on the Zamami node. She may do well there."

"Two birds with one stone?" The bearded soldier fingered his weapon.

"Precisely."

"Well?"

"Get away from her\!" I rushed up as the hooded man reached out to her. In a flash of sungleam, two guns were aimed at me. I anticipated being cut down at any moment. But I heard no pops or bangs. As I ducked my shoulder to tackle him, I noticed how the air moved around him, all distorted and blurry. Then there was the heat. Sweaty, humid, boiling. Like standing over a stove, windows shut, no air, no mercy. Heat stacked on heat, execrable heat, profane heat— too much for flesh to bear.

That’s when his hand reached out and grabbed my wrist with magma intensity.

"Wh-what AAH\!" The bestial バケもの burned me\!

Through my wet vision, I saw the igneous burning of the veiny lava flows of his wrist. The texture was that of the cutting coral shoals surrounding tide pools and housing all manner of sea-life surrounding Okinawa. Pain kept me from outright pandemonium—skosh short of madness. But after he swung me to the surface I rolled away, clutching my smoking forearm in agony. Burned, broken, dizzy, I looked up.

"Meio\! No\!"

The boat cleaved the waves, motor ripping the air, my sister was their prisoner.

I failed.

## Sun’s Reasons

"When you’re out of your element there is forbidden energy all around. Part of you waits to be regulated as refuse, and no amount of soothing can bring order to swinging madness."

"You say this as if it’s an absolute."

"Because I know it’s true."

"How so?"

"Take him, Cinder as an example: once he revolted in his country of fate, he has been reborn into sanguine form. Did you see the way he flung that kid into coarse sand?"

"Quite brutal, it was."

"I don’t disagree, however, this is the way of the world. Those who dare to go beyond their appointed share reap larger gains. These gains come in the form of choice: freedom enduring."

"I suppose you’re not wrong. But what form of freedom do you want?"

"Hmm. Do you know about banshees?"

"Sure. Loud, shrieking, sometimes ghastly, occasionally describes a woman displaying obnoxious behavior. That sort of creature?"

"Haha, yes yes. Were you aware they were harbingers of death in Irish folklore?"

\---

"I wasn’t."

"I hear her or an equivalent spirit of these islands—"

"Like the 船幽霊 (funayūrei), the ship ghosts, believed to be spirits of the drowned here?"

"Uh, yes like them. The cries of the banshee foretell of a coming mob of ignorance, like a rising wave that threatens to inundate us all. But people like him have isolated themselves from the coming calamity, his power is awesomely terrifying."

"Terrifying? Do I sense fear?"

"I do hope so. I said there wasn’t, a whiff of it. But once we get there and go through with the procedure, there’s no going back."

"What about the brothers? Do you think they’ll get it?"

"…perhaps maybe no… I don’t know, they may never understand it. (Sigh) I just hope they know that I’m no creep or freak. That I did all this to make us better, stronger. The system will only accept cosmic inputs. As I am, I can’t provide that at the moment. Yet once I get so endured, then there’s no stopping turning the universe of humanity and beyond."

## Chinese Massage

Lying on the table smashed under a panting Chinese dude’s press is not how I normally prefer to brunch on a Saturday. The whole experience is less than ideal. 

The looping music. Low lights. Super-perfumed air. Room the size of a burial tomb. Yep, the whole arrangement sums to a lousy— scratch that— "unfavorable" scenario that I *get* to experience. I tell myself that as the masseuse (whose credentials are dubious) drags his knuckles down the muscle of my back with one hand while the other? Well it’s conveniently stabilizing him as it skirts the flesh of my mashed breast. Is that routine? I wince as he completes the pass and changes sides.

The ability to endure this hell buys me many things. Most important of which is a few more days of unimpeded movement. Take the pain to have a little less pain later. Without the teeth-grinding. It’s like that.

On a locked down island like this, that’s essential. Then I also get closer to a shot at them, and saving my life in the process. A girl’s gotta have goals. Just so happens mine pair best with meaty hands swirling my buttocks and the power-pills in my fake purse. Fake leather. Real salvation.

My head’s between his crotch now as he rings the back of my neck with cat-strangling force. Then there’s a digital bleating from the side. My phone.

I shoot my head up and hear a surprisingly mousey wail come from the well-built Chinese dude in the black shirt. He hisses and curses in Mandarin, while cupping his junk.

I answer the phone.

"Yeah?"

"They’re on the move. Headed to Zamami. Are you covered?"

I snatch a look down at my topless form under the tiny towel.

"You could say that."

"This is no time for Koi-ness. Yes or no?"

A pause. The masseuse is breathing too close behind me. The smell of cigarette pricks through the garden scent air. 

"Yes, yes of course I am."

"Good. Transportation’s arranged. Kadena Marina. 1800\. They’ll take you."

"Got it."

"Watch yourself. The first freak is with him."

"I thought I smelled something burning."

"Heh you were right. Once you arrive, I’ll be in touch. No mistakes this time."

"Same to you."

"Cute."

I end the call. The masseuse is just standing there, patient. Then I drop the towel, sit up and reach for my bra and dress.

"No, no no, no\!" He covers his eyes and sidles out of the room, red-faced.

Well there goes his tip.

## [Archivist's Note \#2](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/11DCxvn3lqAYl5mvK3-EPIeRkbn_lhdcHbBJhBh6H31M/edit)

Account \#471 \- Rukiko Yonabaru, Age 46 \- Kitanakagusuku City

\*Emotion: Grief\*

Why do we have to hide again? They told us PLA soldiers were patrolling the streets. That's the reason they gave, though they didn't have to. 

I saw the trucks, heavy with guns, colored a muck-green. The smell of fuels made me gag before we fled to the high caves. Just as in all the old war stories, we became prisoners on our own island as the elders had. But I had no family to protect. Are, the angelic dog, ran at the rumble of the massive tires. I haven't seen him in hours.

My heart is sad at my failure.

\---

The page felt heavier than it should. Not metaphorically— actually heavy, as if the words themselves had mass and the testimony of Rukiko Yonabaru carried the weight of her missing dog, her failed protection, her inherited fear. I set it down carefully, a surgeon placing a diseased organ on the tray. My fingers traced the edges— once, twice, three times— aligning them with the stack beneath until the corners kissed perfectly.

Are. Such a small name for such a large absence.

The "Emotion" label caught my eye like a fish hook. Blue ballpoint, recent. Not my father's hand— his was cramped and tiny, four letters crushed together like refugees in a boat. This was someone else's taxonomy of grief, someone who thought sorrow could be filed and categorized and \*labeled\* like a specimen in that same insectary where I'd first begun my descent. 

Who had done this? The manifest said nothing about emotional coding. The IGET documentation was silent. Yet here it sat, clinical and cold: \*Emotion: Grief.\* As if that explained anything. As if that contained the dog named Are and the caves and the smell of fuel that made a woman gag.

I picked up my pen. Tapped it against the margin— \*tap tap tap\*— a rhythm that answered the boxes' earlier chorus. Started to write. Crossed it out. The ink bled slightly on the crossing-out, a small black wound. Started again.

\*Check: Who added emotional categories? Not in manifest. Purpose? Control? Or something else?\*

The next account waited like a patient with a terminal diagnosis.

\---

\*\*Account \#302 \- Tatsuya Hiroo, Age 40, Naha City\*\*

\*Emotion: Satisfaction\*

We heard them in the old Shuri Castle tunnels. The ones they said were sealed after the reconstruction. But they were never sealed, not really. My son found the entrance behind the foundation stones. He went in with his friends. 

Only he came back out.

He wouldn't say what he saw. Just kept saying it over and over: "They're satisfied now. They're satisfied now."

He stopped eating three days later.

\---

Satisfaction.

The word was a stone in my mouth. Heavy and wrong-shaped, metallic-tasting. I bit my lip— old habit, grounding technique— and tasted copper. A child stops eating and the archivist (not me, someone before me, someone who handled these papers with different hands) writes \*Satisfaction\* like it's a reasonable conclusion. Like satisfaction and starvation share the same root system.

My margin note grew thorns as I rewrote it:

\*Labeling system is WRONG. Deliberately wrong? Check all emotional categories against content. Is this misdirection? Is this their language or ours?\*

The boxes behind me settled with a long, drawn-out groan— the sound of old joints, old wood, old secrets trying to get comfortable in their confinement. I didn't turn around. Didn't need to. I could feel their attention, that portrait-with-traveling-eyes sensation that had been my companion since the delivery men left. 

The shortest account sat on top of the pile like a gravestone.

\---

\*\*Account \#089 \- Anonymous \- Kin Town\*\*

\*Emotion: Remorse\*

The darkness remembers.

\---

That was all. Five syllables. The page had nothing else— no explanation, no context, just that phrase sitting there like a curse or a prayer or both. I turned it over. Nothing. Flipped it back. The darkness remembers. The paper was thicker than the others, textured like skin. My fingers didn't want to hold it.

Because I'd seen this before.

Not this account— I would have remembered this account, this brevity, this horror— but the phrase itself. It lived somewhere in the stack I'd already cataloged, nested in another testimony like a parasite. I rifled through the papers, my careful organization collapsing as documents scattered across the desk in a way that made my chest tighten. There. Account \#213. A woman from Chatan— her daughter's nightmares— \*She keeps saying 'the darkness remembers, mama.' She's never heard the old stories. How does she know that phrase?\*

And here in \#089, stated as fact. No question mark. No fear. Just: \*The darkness remembers.\*

Two separate witnesses. Same exact words. The daughter shouldn't know. The anonymous source from Kin Town offers no explanation of \*what\* remembers or \*how\* or \*why\*.

I stood. Too fast. The chair scraped— a sound like fingernails on slate. The papers needed reorganizing. The sequence was broken. Type B civilian accounts were supposed to flow chronologically but someone had misfiled \#089 or I had or the boxes themselves had shuffled their contents while I slept. While I wasn't looking. While I \*blinked\*.

I needed to think. To connect. I'd read so much in three days— Bonta's diary about the arrested silence, that mean quiet that preceded the invasion. The boy who'd described the clouds forming an inverted pyramid, pointing west. Ships appearing like coffins without crew. Half-men, half-shadows walking ashore. Moreau's vivisected creatures made real.

And then the military files. The brothers.

Shade in the middle— the practical one, the one whose helmet cam had captured everything. Scorch the youngest— already obsessed with something in the trees during that first beach battle. The way he'd looked at the jungle like it was looking back. And Sun, the oldest, always distant, always working that tablet, talking in riddles about becoming something that couldn't be crushed.

The Dare system. That's what they'd called it. Some kind of augmentation protocol where they burned Energy and pushed their bodies past human limits until their Exposure meters screamed red. I'd read the technical specs but they felt thin, inadequate. The footage told a different story— the Triple Dare they'd executed on that beach, the \*Daybreak Trinity\*, where all three brothers synchronized and the air itself warped. The way time stuttered. The way Scorch's weapon had jammed and Shade had saved him and Sun had orchestrated it all with that calm, detached voice.

But it was after the battle that things went wrong.

The campfire footage. I'd watched it twice, read the transcript four times. The way Scorch kept staring at the trees. The way he'd heard Shade's voice coming from the jungle— \*"Foo you just said that. What the fuck"\*— the exact words Shade had spoken twenty-three minutes earlier. An echo. Or a recording. Or something worse.

And Sun. Sun talking about the Lego town their father had destroyed. \*"We become something they can't walk through. A force of comparable size. Comparable capability."\* Not armies. Something else. The humming that had started then, three breathing patterns woven together— two human, one mechanical. The shadow that moved wrong while Sun's body stayed perfectly still.

That was the last time the three brothers appeared together in a single frame. After that: separation. Fragmentation. The mission logs referenced "communication difficulties" and "unit cohesion concerns" but provided no detail. Shade had described it during his debriefing (before he disappeared) as "the last time we were in the same room but not in the same world."

And there was a woman's name that kept appearing. Timeera Koi. Mother? Operative? The files contradicted themselves. She was alive. She was dead. She was everywhere and nowhere. An anchor that had failed or been cut loose.  
And then there was Timeera Koi.  
Eight accounts mentioned her. Eight completely incompatible versions. Mother. Operative. Victim. Witness. Anchor. Alive on Kadena on March 3rd. Dead on Ishigaki on March 1st— two days after her confirmed death. The timeline was a shattered mirror, and she was the largest shard.  
One document stood out: an intercepted communication log from a massage parlor in Naha. Civilian cover. The transcript was brief, clinical— someone (Koi?) arranging transport to Zamami just as Shade's mission logs indicated he was headed there. The voice on the other end had warned about "the first freak." Cinder, maybe? The files referenced a C-Unit operative known for thermal signatures.  
But whose side was she on? The phone call suggested she was tracking the brothers, but the word "them" could mean anything. Protecting? Hunting? Containing?  
My father had underlined her name in three separate reports, always with a question mark. Never an explanation. As if he'd died still trying to figure out what she was.  
I smoothed the pages flat. Once. Twice. My hands were shaking.

I needed the rest of Type A. The military files that would explain what happened after the brothers separated. Where Shade went (Zamami Island, Node 1). Where Scorch ended up (Tokashiki, fever and rage according to the fragments). Where Sun...

Where Sun had become whatever he'd become.

The wall of boxes sagged against the far side of my study like exhausted soldiers. Most I'd already opened— their contents metastasizing across every surface, my once-clean space now infected with paper and photographs and maps marked with routes that led nowhere. Five boxes remained. I'd been systematic. Clinical. Type B first (civilian), then Type A (military), then cross-reference until the truth emerged like a fossil from stone.

But the truth wasn't emerging. It was \*multiplying\*.

I approached the remaining boxes. That compressed heat rolled off them— not imagination, not stress-induced hallucination, but actual physical warmth like standing too close to a furnace. The dank Okinawa smell had intensified over the past three days, that corrosive perfume seeping out through cardboard pores. My study didn't smell like my study anymore. It smelled like caves. Like salt water and copper and that other thing— that \*meat\* smell that had no business coming from paper.

I reached for the second box from the left.

My fingers found the lid seam and pulled.

Nothing.

Not locked. Not taped. But \*fused\*. The cardboard had melted together or calcified or become one continuous surface, the seam still visible but non-functional, like a scar that had healed too tightly. I pulled harder. Wedged my fingers into the gap. The space was there— I could see it, a shadow-line where the lid should separate— but my hands wouldn't fit. Or the box wouldn't let them.

The box resisted me like a living thing protecting its organs.

Water damage, I told myself. The manifest mentioned flooding. 2034\. The Kadena facility. Moisture would do this— warp the cardboard, seal it shut through some chemical process I didn't understand but could research, could \*solve\*, because that's what I did. I solved puzzles. I made order from chaos. I was trained for this.

But the box was dry. Desert-dry. And warm. Always warm.

I stepped back. Retrieved my notepad. Wrote carefully, each letter a small act of control:

\*Box 4A (second from left) \- inaccessible. Possible water damage (though box is dry?). Requires specialist tools or conservator. Contact Tanaka or Lt. Chen. Not urgent.\*

The last two words were a lie so obvious even the pen seemed to protest, the ink flowing thicker, darker. Because this \*was\* urgent. The sealed box sat there like a missing tooth, a gap in the smile of information, and every instinct I had— archival training, curiosity, grief, rage— screamed that what I needed was \*in there\*. 

Sun's final logs, maybe. The explanation for why the brothers' voices had started echoing back from the trees. The truth about that humming, those three breathing patterns, that mechanical third presence on the tablet. The records that would tell me if Scorch had survived the fever, if Shade had made it past Node 1, if Sun had completed whatever transformation he'd started around that campfire.

Or something worse than records. Something that explained why the box sealed itself. Why it stayed silent while the others hummed and breathed and \*watched\*.

I set my pen down. Perpendicular to the notepad. Parallel to the desk edge. Order. Control. These were my weapons against the chaos.

That's when the boxes began to speak.

\---

\*Tap.\*

Small. Dismissible. The kind of sound cardboard makes when temperature shifts or humidity changes or a building settles into its foundation. I'd heard it before— constant low percussion since the delivery. Background noise. Ignorable.

I turned back to my desk. Back to Bonta's diary where he'd described the silence before the invasion. That arrested silence. Mean and waiting.

\*Tap. Tap.\*

Sharper now. Localized. Coming from the left side of the wall where the oldest boxes slouched. Not settling. Not random. The rhythm was too regular, too \*purposeful\*, like Morse code or a heartbeat or fingernails drumming against the inside of a coffin lid.

My pen hovered over Account \#089. The darkness remembers. The ink began to bleed slightly where I'd been holding the nib too long in one spot.

\*Tap tap tap.\*

I turned. Slowly. The boxes sat exactly as before— sagging, defeated, innocent. The sealed box second from the left, silent as a grave. But the tapping continued, and now I could pinpoint the source: the box on the far left, the one I'd opened first three days ago. The one that had contained the beach battle footage. The one that smelled like meat.

"Temperature change," I said aloud. My voice sounded thin and small, a child's voice in an empty house. "Humidity. Expansion and contraction. Completely normal."

The tapping stopped.

The silence was a held breath. Was a pause before the fall. Was Bonta's arrested silence made manifest in my study. Worse— infinitely worse— than the noise.

I counted to ten. Slowly. Clinical. The climate control hummed its steady mechanical lullaby. Outside, a car passed on the street below, normal and alive and \*outside\* where the world still made sense. I exhaled. Picked up my pen. Started to write a note about auditory hallucinations and stress and—

\*Tap-tap-tap-tap-tap.\*

From the right side of the wall this time. Faster. Insistent. A different box entirely, and before I could process that, another box joined in from the left. Then another. Then another. Until four boxes were tapping in sequence, in \*conversation\*, a rhythm that sounded almost like—

Like footsteps walking a perimeter.

Like something circling, looking for weakness, testing the boundaries of its cardboard prison. Like Sun doing his perimeter check while the humming started.

My pen fell. The clatter was sharp and immediate. The tapping stopped— all four boxes at once, synchronized, as if they'd heard me. As if they'd been \*listening\*.

Just like the helmet cam. Just like that moment when Scorch went still and said \*"Yo. You hear that?"\* and heard Shade's voice coming from the trees even though Shade was sitting right there.

The silence pressed down like deep water. Like standing at the bottom of the ocean. My ears rang with the absence of sound. Even the climate control seemed to have quit, or maybe I'd gone deaf, or maybe sound itself had been password-protected and I'd forgotten the code, just like Bonta's radios and scooters and vending trucks.

Then: \*Thummmmm.\*

Not a tap. A hum. Low and resonant, vibrating up through the floor and into my bones and teeth. Coming from all the boxes at once— except one.

The sealed box sat silent. Dead. Judgmental.

While the others hummed and thrummed like organs in a body, that one remained perfectly, terribly still. The control specimen. The unopened variable. The thing I couldn't access no matter how much I needed to.

The hum rose in pitch. Became almost musical. Almost like—

Three distinct patterns woven together: one fast and shallow (Shade's panic breathing), one steady but hitching (Scorch's pain), one thin and mechanical (the tablet that shouldn't breathe). The same patterns from the campfire footage. The same patterns from the night everything went wrong.

"Stop it," I whispered.

The humming intensified. The boxes swelled— I saw it, actually watched their cardboard sides bulge slightly like lungs inflating. That compressed heat rolled off them in waves that made the air shimmer. The smell hit next: copper and salt and \*meat\*, that rot-stink of flesh left too long in tropical heat, even though these were only papers, only documents, only \*words\*.

But boxes don't breathe. Boxes don't hum. Boxes don't \*remember\*.

Except these did.

I couldn't move. My body had locked down— prey animal stillness, the hindbrain taking over from the thinking mind. My pulse hammered in my throat with black-night highway speed worry, just like Bonta's pulse, just like my father's must have been in those final days, surrounded by these same boxes, listening to them whisper and hum and demand.

The sealed box stayed silent. Watching. Patient. Waiting for me to understand what Sun had meant when he said \*"We become something they can't walk through."\*

My feet carried me forward. I didn't decide to move. My body simply acted, pulled by a force deeper than reason or training or self-preservation. Three steps across my study— past my desk, past the scattered papers, past the point where I could pretend this was normal. My hand reached out toward the nearest humming box while the sealed box radiated that terrible patience in my peripheral vision, and I knew— \*knew\*— that this was the moment I'd been moving toward since the delivery men left, since I'd signed the release forms, since I'd first seen my father's four-letter signature at the foot of a witness statement.

This was the slow slide down into the antlion's trap. The greedy fine grains shifting beneath me.

I touched the cardboard.

It was hot. Feverish. \*Alive.\*

The humming stopped. All of them at once— instant silence. Even the climate control. Even my own breath caught and held. In that void of sound— that arrested silence, that mean quiet— I heard it:

A voice. Thin and distant. Coming from inside the box beneath my palm. Words I couldn't make out but inflection I recognized— the cadence of explanation, of justification, of a man trying to make his daughter understand why he'd done what he'd done. Why he'd chosen to witness. Why he'd let them separate.

My father's voice.

My fingers found the lid seam. Started to lift. And as the cardboard separated with a sound like tearing skin, I thought of Scorch staring at the trees and saying \*"Dis place is fucked. We gotta get off. Go home."\* I thought of Sun's shadow growing and shrinking while his body stayed still. I thought of Account \#089, that single line sitting in my mind like a warning I'd ignored:

\*The darkness remembers.\*

\---

Ferries weren't supposed to feel like coffins, but that one tried. The smell of diesel hung low and thick, clinging to the back of my throat like a greasy film. The seats shone with old sweat — vinyl worn to a slick patina by years of bodies that didn't want to be there. The few other passengers wore the same glazed look as livestock waiting to be herded off at market. Too quiet. Too still. Even the elderly woman three rows up hadn't moved in twenty minutes, hands folded in her lap like she was already practicing for the grave.

Normal enough, I told myself. That was always the danger cue.

The water beyond the salt-crusted windows looked wrong. Not rough — we were past typhoon season — but \*dark\*. The kind of dark that swallowed light instead of reflecting it. Okinawa's waters used to be that tourist-brochure turquoise, the shade that made mainlanders fork over their savings for a long weekend. Now it looked like old blood mixed with engine oil. Occupation did that. Turned paradise into a crime scene and made everyone complicit just by staying alive.

I catalogued exits out of habit: main door (forward, currently blocked by a sailor smoking despite the NO SMOKING sign), emergency hatch (starboard, rusted shut from the looks of it), windows (too small, but breakable in a pinch). Three potential hostiles visible — two sailors, one ticket-taker who moved like he'd done military time. The rest were civilians. Probably.

The loudspeaker crackled to life. Captain's voice, bored and nasal: "Departure in two minutes. All passengers remain seated—" 

The audio cut. Just for a second. A hitch in the broadcast like someone had pressed pause. When it resumed, the captain's cadence was slightly off. Flatter. Like he was reading phonetically from a script he didn't understand.

I noted the time: 1342 hours. First anomaly.

Two minutes past cast-off, the "normal" shattered.

Boots stormed the deck — heavy, arrhythmic, the clatter of men who'd learned to march but forgotten why. A half-dozen soldiers spilled aboard from a patrol boat that pulled alongside, late and loud, as if discipline had been left behind on the pier. They wore Japanese Self-Defense Force uniforms, but the patches were wrong. Stitched too recent, colors too bright. The kind of costume work that passed at a distance but fell apart under scrutiny.

They fanned out to posts like props in a half-rehearsed stage play. One positioned himself near the bow, rifle slung too low. Another blocked the bathroom corridor, picking at his fingernails with the edge of a combat knife. The rest scattered with no clear tactical purpose, more interested in looking imposing than actually securing anything.

One of them made me pause.

Too short. Five-foot-nothing, maybe less. Shoulders slouched forward like he was trying to compress himself into a smaller target. He kept tugging at his mask strap where it bit into his ear, adjusting and re-adjusting in a way that screamed \*discomfort\* instead of \*routine\*. His rifle hung the way a broom did in a child's hands — awkward, unfamiliar, like he'd been handed it five minutes ago and told to "look military."

His boots were two sizes too big. I could see the gap at the heel.

I made a note: \*Possible infiltrator. Age 14-16. Threat level: minimal. Comedy value: moderate.\*

\---

Diplomat papers got me waved through the first layer of inspection. A young soldier — actual PLA by the accent, mainland Mandarin with Beijing edges — scanned my documents with a handheld reader that beeped twice and flashed green. His eyes lingered on my face, then dropped. Chest. Hips. Back up when he remembered he was supposed to be professional.

I let him look. It bought me three extra seconds while his brain rebooted.

"Purpose of travel?" His voice came out slightly higher than intended.

"Agricultural consultation." I leaned forward just enough. The blouse wasn't cut low, but geometry did the rest. "Wild boar population assessment. Zamami's had complaints."

His gaze stuttered. Tried to stay on my face. Failed. "I... uh. Yes. Paperwork is—" He cleared his throat, handed the documents back too quickly, fingers fumbling. "—in order. You may proceed."

I smiled. Not warm. Just enough to let him know I'd noticed.

He flushed red to his hairline.

Behind him, an older soldier — the one with the scar bisecting his left eyebrow — watched the exchange with the dead-eyed patience of someone who'd seen it all before. He didn't look at me the way the young one did. He looked at me the way you'd look at a weapon someone left on the table. Functional. Dangerous. Requiring attention.

I filed his face away. That one would be a problem if things went sideways.

\---

I made a show of heading for the bathroom, weaving through the narrow aisle as another static burst cut through the loudspeaker. This time the captain's voice didn't return immediately. In the gap, I heard something else. Faint. Childlike. A snatch of melody that cut off before I could place it.

Second anomaly. 1349 hours.

The bathroom corridor reeked of industrial cleaner — the kind that stripped paint along with grime — and something sharper underneath. Sweat. Fear. And something else. Something organic and wrong.

Burned meat.

I paused. Inhaled carefully through my nose. There. Faint but unmistakable. The sickly-sweet char of seared flesh, recent enough that the smell hadn't fully dissipated into the ferry's general miasma of diesel and disinfectant.

One soldier had been in there too long. Suspicious. Or injured. Or both.

I knocked once. No answer.

I opened the door anyway.

\---

The kid jerked upright at the sink, hands braced against the porcelain like he'd been about to vomit. His eyes went wide behind the mask — actual terror, the kind that freezes limbs and stops breath. He was wearing a jacket. Thin windbreaker, completely wrong for the humid ferry heat. The sleeves hung past his wrists.

Covering something.

I shut the door behind me. Locked it.

"Relax," I said. "If I wanted you dead, you'd be bleeding already."

He didn't relax. His hand drifted toward the rifle slung across his back, then stopped halfway like he'd remembered he didn't know how to use it. His other arm stayed pressed against his torso, protective.

I reached out and peeled the mask off. He flinched but didn't resist — just a whimper caught in his throat, body going rigid.

Bonta Higa stared back at me. Fifteen, maybe sixteen. Round face, soft jaw still carrying baby fat, eyes too large and wet with barely-suppressed panic. The kind of kid who probably got good grades and helped old ladies cross the street before occupation turned childhood into a liability.

"Guess physical requirements aren't what they used to be," I said.

His mouth worked soundlessly. Then, in broken English that crashed between languages: "How—how you know I not real soldier?"

I grabbed his jacket collar, pulled him closer. He gasped — pain, sharp and immediate. His left arm jerked, and I caught the edge of something beneath the sleeve. Angry red, blistered. The smell intensified.

"Because real soldiers don't smell like barbecue," I said. Kept my voice flat. Clinical. "And they don't wince when someone touches them."

His eyes darted left, right, looking for escape routes that didn't exist. "I—it was accident. Cooking accident. Very clumsy, me."

"Show me."

"What? No, I—"

I didn't ask again. Just grabbed his left wrist and yanked the sleeve up.

The wound was fresh. Angry. Wrong.

Not a burn from fire or stove or any conventional heat source. The pattern was too specific — radiating lines that looked almost \*textured\*, like someone had pressed molten coral against his skin and held it there. The edges were cauterized, but the center still wept clear fluid. Thermal contact, high intensity, direct application. The kind of precision that only came from weaponized augmentation.

I'd seen burns like this before. In briefing photos. Classified reports with black bars and clinical language that tried to make horror sound routine.

Champion operative. Thermal class.

The kid was staring at his own arm like it belonged to someone else, breathing hard through his nose. "Please don't—don't tell them. I need to get to Zamami. I need—" His voice cracked. "Please."

I let go of his wrist. He yanked the sleeve down, clutching his arm against his chest.

"Who did this to you?"

"I told you, cooking—"

"Kid." I leaned in. Close enough that he had to look at me. "I've seen a lot of injuries. That's not from a stove. That's not from anything normal. So either you tell me what happened, or I drag you to those soldiers outside and let \*them\* ask."

His face went pale. Lips trembled. For a second I thought he might actually crack, spill everything in a panicked teenage confession.

Then his eyes dropped.

Not to my face. Lower.

I watched it happen in real-time: fear-brain shutting down, lizard-brain taking over. Fifteen-year-old hormones overriding survival instinct. His gaze locked on my chest, lingered, then drifted down like it had weights attached.

I let him stare for exactly two seconds. Timed it. Then:

"Your gaze has a gravity problem. Eyes up, kid."

His head snapped up so fast I heard his neck crack. Face went nuclear-red, sweat beading on his forehead. "I—I wasn't—I mean—sorry\! Sorry sorry sorry\!" He covered his eyes with both hands, wincing as the burned arm protested the movement. "Very sorry, onee-san\! Was not looking at—I mean, was not meaning to—ah, dame dame dame—"

"Save it." I straightened, put distance between us. Professional. Cold. "You've got bigger problems than being a teenage idiot. Someone burned you. Recently. And you're on a military ferry to Zamami in a stolen uniform. That's either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid."

He lowered his hands slowly, still not quite meeting my eyes. Safer to look at the wall. "Is... is both. Maybe."

"Why Zamami?"

His jaw clenched. "My grandmother. She sick. Very sick."

The lie sat there between us, brittle and obvious. But underneath it, something else bled through. Desperation. Real fear. The kind that made kids do suicidally stupid things.

Before I could press further, the loudspeaker rattled alive. The captain's voice, but wrong again — too fast, words bleeding together:

"Attention all passengers unscheduled security inspection remain in your seats do not move inspection teams will proceed compartment by compartment—"

No pause for breath. No natural rhythm. Like someone had spliced the announcement together from separate recordings.

Third anomaly. 1353 hours.

Boots thundered in the corridor. Close. Getting closer.

\---

"Shit." I grabbed Bonta by the collar — carefully, avoiding the burned arm — and shoved him into the stall. "Get in. Shut up. Make a sound and I'll tell them exactly where you are."

"But—"

"\*Now.\*"

He scrambled into the stall, jacket bunching awkwardly. I heard him fumble with the lock, curse under his breath in Japanese, fumble again.

I straightened my blouse, checked my reflection. Diplomat. Consultant. Bored professional on a routine trip. The mask slipped on easy as breathing.

The door slammed open.

Two soldiers. Real ones this time — older, harder-faced, with the dead eyes of men who'd stopped pretending this was peacekeeping. The lead one had a scar bisecting his left eyebrow, puckered and keloid-thick. Same one who'd watched me earlier.

His gaze swept the bathroom, clinical and thorough. Didn't linger on my body the way the younger soldier had. Just assessed threats, calculated odds, moved on.

That made him dangerous.

"Papers," he said. Mandarin with Okinawan vowels underneath. Local recruit.

I handed them over, movements slow and deliberate. Non-threatening. The second soldier — younger, twitchier, definitely staring now — kept his rifle pointed at my midsection. Safety off. Finger on the guard, not the trigger. Trained but green.

Scar scanned the documents. His eyes flicked to me. Back to the photo. Back to me. Taking his time.

I waited. Let him look. Professional interest only — he was checking for discrepancies, not appreciating the view. But the younger one behind him was doing both, gaze skating down then jerking back up when I met his eyes.

"Purpose of travel?"

"Agricultural consultation. Wild boar assessment." I kept my voice bored. Routine. "Your captain has the full manifest."

"Captain doesn't tell us shit." He flipped through the pages, squinting at the stamps. Then, switching to Mandarin: "\*Where did you study?\*"

Testing me.

"\*Beijing Foreign Studies University,\*" I lied smoothly. "\*Class of 2019\. Professor Wang's program.\*"

His expression didn't change, but something shifted behind his eyes. That was a real program. A real professor. The forgery included biographical depth most operatives didn't bother with.

He handed the papers back. "Wait outside."

\---

They searched the bathroom with the efficiency of men who'd done this a hundred times. Checked the stalls, the cistern, even ran their hands along the ceiling panels looking for contraband taped to the underside.

Bonta stayed silent. Credit where due — the kid had decent survival instincts when terror overrode hormones.

The younger soldier lingered at the locked stall door. Frowned. "Locked?"

My pulse didn't change. "Broken latch. Been like that since we boarded."

He rattled it once. Twice. The door held.

Scar grunted. "Move on. We've got twelve more compartments."

They filed out. The corridor boots faded.

I counted to thirty before unlocking the stall.

Bonta spilled out, face flushed, breathing hard through his mouth. "That was—that was—" He clutched his chest dramatically, then winced as the movement pulled his burned arm. "Heart racing like... like..."

"Like you almost got arrested?" I checked the corridor. Empty for now. "Why are you really here? And don't say grandmother."

His bravado crumbled. He looked at the floor, at the walls, anywhere but at me. His jaw worked, trying to form words that wouldn't come.

"I..." He swallowed hard. Tried again. "I need to get to Zamami. Is very important."

"Important enough to steal a uniform and risk prison?"

He nodded. Didn't elaborate.

I watched him. Read the microexpressions: fear, desperation, guilt, determination. Fifteen years old and completely out of his depth. But not lying about the stakes. Whatever he was chasing on Zamami mattered more than his own safety.

The burn made sense now. He'd encountered something — someone — enhanced. Thermal operative. Champion class. And he'd survived, barely, with information he didn't know was classified.

Liability. But possibly useful.

"Take the uniform off," I said. "You're about as covert as a fireworks display."

"But how will I—"

"Not my problem. Figure it out or get arrested. Your call."

I left him there, wrestling with oversized sleeves and the weight of very bad decisions.

\---

Knees protested as I climbed the stairs to the open deck — that grinding sensation, bone on bone, cartilage that had given up pretending to do its job. I made a note: \*L. knee instability, 1353-1407 hrs. Manageable. Suboptimal.\*

They'd read it. They always did. Monitoring my decline with the same clinical interest they'd apply to any deteriorating asset. How many more missions before she's too broken to deploy? Place your bets, gentlemen.

I dry-swallowed two pills from the blister pack in my jacket. Not the good stuff — that was rationed, saved for when I couldn't afford to limp. These were just NSAIDs, over-the-counter garbage that barely touched the inflammation. But they kept me functional.

Functional was all the job required.

The deck air bit cold despite the afternoon sun. Salt spray misted across the railings, leaving everything slick and treacherous. I found a spot near the stern where I could watch both entrances and settled in to wait.

The water looked worse up here. That dead-blood darkness stretched to the horizon, broken only by the ferry's wake — a white scar that healed behind us as fast as we made it. In the distance, Zamami was a gray smudge against grayer sky, getting closer with the slow inevitability of a deadline.

Beautiful, in a broken-glass kind of way. Like watching something die in slow motion and calling it sunset.

Bonta emerged fifteen minutes later, stripped down to a threadbare shirt with a faded Gundam print and jeans that had seen better decades. The uniform was bundled under his good arm like evidence he didn't know how to dispose of.

He spotted me. Hesitated. Then approached with the guilty shuffle of a kid who knew he was about to get yelled at.

"What do I do with this?" He held up the uniform, helpless.

I nodded at the water. "Ocean's right there."

His eyes widened. "But—but littering is—"

"\*Ocean.\*"

He hesitated, then flung it overboard with the conviction of someone committing their first real crime. We both watched it sink — olive drab swallowed by dark water, gone in seconds.

"So," I said, not looking at him. "What's actually worth risking prison for?"

"My grandmother." Immediate. Practiced. "She's very sick. I need to see her before—" He made a vague gesture that probably meant \*death\* but looked more like \*confused bird.\*

I let the lie hang there. Didn't bother puncturing it.

Movement to my left. Two soldiers — different ones, fresh rotation — approached with the casual swagger of men who'd been given vague orders to "look official." The lead one was stocky, crew-cut, with the kind of face that looked angry even when smiling.

"Papers," he barked. Not asking.

I handed them over. Again. He scanned them with less care than Scar had, clearly going through motions.

Then his eyes landed on Bonta.

"Who's the kid?"

I didn't hesitate. "My assistant."

Bonta's head whipped toward me, eyes wide. I stepped on his foot. Hard. He swallowed whatever protest had been forming.

Crew-cut looked between us. Skeptical. "Assistant for wild boar assessment?"

"Field work requires local knowledge. He's from Zamami. Knows the terrain." I kept my voice flat. Bored. Like I'd had to explain this a hundred times already. "It's in the manifest."

It wasn't. But the manifest was forty pages of bureaucratic tedium and Crew-cut didn't look like the reading type.

He grunted. "Kid doesn't look like much."

"He's cheap," I said. "Budget constraints."

Bonta made a small offended noise. I stepped on his foot again.

Crew-cut handed the papers back, already losing interest. "Stay out of the way."  
They moved on. Bonta waited until they were out of earshot, then: "Assistant? Assistant?"  
"You're welcome."  
"But I don't know anything about boars\!"  
"Neither do I, kid. But now we're both committed to the lie." I pulled out my phone, opened the notes app. Started typing. "Stay close. Don't talk to anyone. And if you see those soldiers again, you're carrying my equipment and taking field notes for minimum wage."  
"How much is minimum?"  
"About a thousand yen an hour. Maybe less if you keep asking stupid questions."  
His face fell. "That's... that's terrible pay."  
"File a complaint with HR."  
"You don't have HR\!"  
"Exactly. Welcome to contractor work."  
My phone buzzed. One long pulse. Encrypted call, scrambled routing. I knew the number.  
"Stay here," I told Bonta. "Don't move. Don't talk. Don't even breathe loud."  
"But—"  
"Don't."  
I walked to the bow, where engine noise and spray would cover my voice. Answered on the third ring.  
"Yeah?"  
"Status." His voice — clipped, familiar, carrying the weight of shared history neither of us wanted to discuss. No greeting. Never a greeting.  
"On schedule. Kadena Marina to Zamami, ETA thirty-five minutes."  
"Complications?"  
I glanced back. Bonta was exactly where I'd left him, leaning against the railing and trying to look invisible. Kid was better at following orders than expected.  
"None worth reporting."  
Pause. The kind that meant he didn't believe me but couldn't prove it. Yet.  
"You still grind your teeth when you're lying?"  
"Wouldn't know. Haven't lied to you recently."  
"Cute." Exhale — cigarette smoke, I could hear it through the line. "The brothers are moving faster than expected. Shade's already on Zamami. Scorch is sick, possibly compromised. Sun's off-grid."  
"Define compromised."  
"Fever. Aggression. Exposure symptoms. If he's turning, you'll need to contain him before he becomes a liability."  
Turning. Such a clean word for what the nodes did to people. Like saying someone "caught a cold" when they were coughing blood.  
"And if containment isn't an option?"  
"Then terminate. You know the parameters." His voice hardened. "The Janus gene is priority one. Everything else is secondary."  
"Including the brothers?"  
"Especially the brothers. They're carriers, not assets. If any of them become unstable—"  
"Neutralize. I know the drill."  
"Do you?" The question hung there, loaded. "Because last time you had a choice between mission success and collateral preservation, you chose wrong."  
My jaw clenched. Old wound, still tender. "That was different."  
"Was it?" He didn't wait for an answer. "Champion operative is confirmed active on Zamami. Thermal class. You'll recognize the signature."  
The kid's burn flashed through my mind. Textured. Coral-pattern. Fresh.  
"Noted," I said. Kept my voice neutral. "Anything else?"  
"Watch yourself. And Koi?" His tone shifted. Almost concerned. Almost. "How's the knee?"  
"Functional."  
"That's not what I asked."  
"It's what you're getting." I ended the call before he could push further. Small victories.  
Note for file: Civilian asset (Bonta Higa, age \~15) encountered Champion operative prior to ferry boarding. Thermal contact burn consistent with C-Class augmentation, fresh trauma indicating recent engagement. Possible witness to Champion activity. Potential intel value: moderate. Threat assessment: minimal. Currently traveling under false pretense (grandmother cover story \- obvious fabrication). True motivation unclear but appears personal/desperate in nature.  
Improvised cover: assistant contractor. Soldies accepted explanation without significant scrutiny. Asset now operationally linked to K-97 for duration of transit. Will maintain cover until Zamami arrival, then reassess utility.  
Secondary note: Would never actually pay the kid more than 1000 yen/hour. Maybe less if he keeps asking stupid questions. Maybe nothing if he keeps staring at my tits like a concussed pigeon.  
Tertiary note: Left knee degradation continues. Logged instability episodes at 1353, 1407, 1438 hours. NSAIDs maintaining baseline functionality. Condition suboptimal but mission-capable. Request medical supply requisition upon return to mainland.  
When I returned to the stern, Bonta was humming — some J-pop song I half-recognized, mangled by his off-key enthusiasm. He stopped when he saw my face.  
"Everything okay, onee-san?"  
"Fine." I leaned against the railing, let the spray mist my face. "Just checking in with people who pay me."  
"Are they nice peoples?"  
"No."  
"Oh." He went quiet. Then: "Are you nice people?"  
I looked at him. Really looked. Fifteen years old, burned arm hidden under a thin jacket, chasing something on Zamami that scared him more than soldiers and prison. Desperate enough to risk everything. Stupid enough to think lying would work.  
"No," I said. "I'm not."  
He nodded slowly. Like that confirmed something he'd already suspected.  
The loudspeaker crackled.  
This time, the sound was wrong from the first syllable. Pitched too high, warbling like a record played at the wrong speed.  
The captain's voice: "Attention passengers we are approaching—"  
Cut. Static hiss.  
Then: children singing.  
High and sweet, a nursery rhyme I didn't recognize. Japanese, but the dialect was old. Pre-war old. The kind that survived in folk songs and forgotten textbooks.  
"Red shoes, red shoes, the girl wore red shoes—"  
Bonta's humming stopped. His head cocked, listening. Confused.  
"She went away on a foreign ship—"  
The children's voices fractured. Multiplied. Now there were dozens, layered and echoing like they were singing from inside a cave. Or a mass grave.  
"She went away and never came back—"  
The melody twisted. Minor key bleeding into dissonance. Wrong notes held too long.  
"What... what is that?" Bonta whispered.  
I didn't answer. Couldn't. Because the children's voices were fading, replaced by something worse.  
Military bark. Sharp commands in Mandarin, clipped and precise: "All units to stations. Perimeter check. Possible contact on approach vector—"  
My training. I recognized the drill call. Naval intercept protocol, standard PLA. But the voice was wrong — too many speakers layered together, consonants duplicating and echoing like the audio had been copied and pasted until it lost coherence.  
Then: my own voice.  
Metallic. Hollow. Echoing across the ferry with the flatness of old surveillance footage:  
"...survive by playing roles. Masks inside masks. The question is which one bleeds when the knife goes in."  
I'd said that. Four months ago. Debriefing after the Ishigaki extraction, when they'd pressed me about operational methodology and I'd been too tired to lie properly. Secure room. Encrypted recording. Meant for classified archives buried so deep even I'd need clearance to access them.  
How the fuck was it playing on a civilian ferry?  
The loudspeaker died. Real silence this time — not just absence of sound, but the thick pressure of something listening. Waiting. The air itself felt heavier, like atmospheric pressure dropping before a storm.  
Bonta's face had gone pale. Salt spray dripped off his lashes, or maybe those were tears. He was fifteen. This was too much. All of it.  
"That wasn't you talking," he said. Quiet. Almost hopeful. Voice cracking on the last word. "Was it?"  
I kept my eyes on the horizon — dark water, darker sky, the thin line between them blurring as Zamami grew closer. Almost there. Almost done with this particular nightmare.  
"Didn't say a word," I told him.  
The ferry's engines churned. The water swallowed the sound. And somewhere in the static-laced silence, I could still hear children singing about red shoes and foreign ships and girls who went away and never came back.  
Just like Bonta's sister, I thought. Then filed the thought away with all the other operational data I'd collected:  
The burn. The lie. The desperate eyes. The way he kept glancing toward Zamami like it held something precious he'd lost.  
Kid was useful. Potentially.  
If I could keep him alive long enough to matter.  
\[Report filed 1847 hours, Zamami approach\]  
Status: Mission-capable. On schedule. No significant delays.  
Assets: Civilian witness acquired. Potential intel value pending further assessment.  
Threats: Champion operative confirmed active. Audio anomalies require investigation — possible psyops, signal intrusion, or equipment compromise. Recommend communications sweep upon landfall.  
Personal: Knee holding. Pain managed. Still functional.  
Conclusion: Proceeding to primary objective. Will maintain cover and monitor for further anomalies. Civilian asset designated temporary contractor status for operational security. Will reassess utility upon arrival.

Rain clouds pressed down on Zamami Village like a held breath. The afternoon had that pre-storm weight—air thick enough to chew, Pacific wind dying to nothing. My knee complained as I crouched behind a weathered concrete wall, but the NSAIDs were keeping it functional. Barely.  
Objective markers painted themselves across my field of vision courtesy of the Glassigs: three patrol routes highlighted in amber, the izakaya SANTA (三楽) pulsing red two blocks northeast. Intel suggested the American was being held there. Intel also suggested Sun had made contact seventy-two hours prior, which meant whatever the hostage knew, it was worth keeping alive.  
For now.  
"Onee-san, do you see—"  
"Don't." I didn't look at him. Kept my eyes on the patrol. "Call me Timeera. Just Timeera."  
"Hai, sorry, I mean—yes, Timeera-san."  
Close enough.  
Bonta Higa crouched beside me, all fifteen-year-old elbows and nervous energy. His burned arm was wrapped in bandages that were already coming loose. Kid couldn't even dress a wound properly. I made a note: *Civilian asset requires constant supervision. Tactical liability.*  
But he could translate. And crawl through spaces I couldn't anymore.  
That made him useful.  
"What do you see?" I asked.  
He squinted past the wall. "Three guards, PLA. Sharing cigarette. Very casual, like... like they're not worried about anything."  
"They aren't." I adjusted the Glassig lens, zooming in. The guards' faces were slack, eyes unfocused even as they laughed at some joke I couldn't hear. "Because they're not really guarding."  
"What you mean?"  
I tapped my ear. "Listen."  
The guards' laughter carried across the empty street—but underneath it, something else. A second rhythm. Like an echo that came *before* the sound.  
Bonta's face went pale. "That's... is that...?"  
"Voice layering. Parasite symptom." I logged the timestamp. **16:51 \- Confirmed puppet activity, three units.** "Stay close. Don't make noise."  
"But I need to—"  
"Later."  
I moved.  
---

**16:53 \- MARKET SQUARE APPROACH**  
*\[Handwritten margin note: "Why didn't she abort when civilian contamination was confirmed?" \- Unknown reviewer\]*  
The market square should have been empty. Occupation protocol, curfew enforcement, pick your excuse. But it wasn't empty. Two dozen people milled through the stalls—shopping, talking, going through the motions of normal life.  
Except nothing about it was normal.  
I stopped at the corner, pulled Bonta down beside me. "Watch."  
An elderly woman at a fruit stand picked up a mikan, examined it, set it down. Picked up the same mikan. Examined it. Set it down. The loop repeated. Exact same movements, same head tilt, same pause.  
"Gadzooks," Bonta whispered. "She's like... like a machine."  
"Puppet," I corrected. "The parasite doesn't replace cognition completely. It hijacks motor function, vocal patterns. They're still conscious. Just not in control."  
The fruit vendor—a man in his forties with a sweat-stained apron—turned toward us. His mouth moved, but the voice that came out was wrong. Too deep. Too precise.  
"Civilian presence restricted to approved zones. Violators will be detained for processing."  
Military cadence. Command structure. Coming from a fruit vendor.  
I logged it: **16:54 \- Voice appropriation confirmed. Command authority transplanted into civilian host.**  
"That's not his voice," Bonta said. "That's... that's like a soldier. A officer."  
"Commander, probably." I watched three children near the fountain. They stood in formation—perfect spacing, parade rest—and sang in unison:  
*"Freedom is entrapment,*  
 *Entrapment is freedom,*  
 *The voice that speaks for you*  
 *Is the only voice you—"*  
\[REDACTED\]  
*\[Margin note: "Censored by whose authority?" \- Unknown\]*  
The singing cut off mid-word. All three children turned toward us simultaneously. Bonta grabbed my arm.  
"We gotta go, we gotta—"  
"*Hey nigga, you gonna paint a picture? Get yo ass over here and get low\!*"  
The voice came from a woman sweeping the steps of a closed pharmacy. But it wasn't her voice. It was young, male, American.  
Scorch.  
I felt my chest tighten. Logged it anyway: **16:56 \- Subject L. Haven voice confirmed in civilian host. Parasitic harvest active.**  
Bonta was shaking. "That's... that's from the battle. I heard them say that. When they were fighting. How is she...?"  
"Because the island doesn't just record voices," I said, keeping my own voice flat, clinical. "The voices record the island."  
*\[Handwritten margin note: "Antimetabole or actual operational theory?" \- Unknown\]*  
I pulled him into the shadow of an alley. The Glassigs painted new routes—one patrol approaching from the west, another circling back from the harbor. We had maybe three minutes before the net tightened.  
"**OBJECTIVE UPDATE: Locate izakaya key. Source: \[CORRUPTED\] ...suggest checking... \[STATIC\] ...old woman, age... \[DATA LOSS\]**"  
The codec crackled in my ear. My handler's voice, breaking apart like wet paper.  
"Say again," I whispered into the throat mic. "You're cutting out."  
"...key holder... \[REDACTED\] ...village elder... Kanemura-san... \[INTERFERENCE\] ...consigliere to the... \[CONNECTION LOST\]"  
Gone.  
I pulled the earpiece out, examined it. No damage. The interference was environmental. Or something worse.  
"Timeera-san, what we do now?"  
I looked at him. Fifteen years old, burned arm, sister kidnapped, adventure dream turning into nightmare fuel. He was trying so hard to keep the archaic exclamations going—"gadzooks" and "merciful heavens"—like if he performed the role, reality would match it.  
I should have sent him back to the ferry.  
"We find the key," I said. "There's an old woman—Kanemura-san. My contact says she's the consigliere around here. The one people actually listen to."  
"Oh\! Oh, I know her\!" Bonta's face lit up. "She's friend of my family. Very old. Like, execrably old."  
"How old?"  
"117 years\!"  
That couldn't be right. "You sure?"  
"Yes, yes\! She live through Battle of Okinawa, American occupation, everything. Everyone know her. She like living history."  
Living history. Or something wearing its skin.  
But if she had the key, I needed her.  
"Where?"  
"Near the harbor. But Timeera-san, we have to be careful. She... she know things. See things. My grandmother say she has the—" He paused, searching for the word. "—the sight. You know?"  
"I know," I said. "Move."

**17:12 \- HARBOR APPROACH**  
*\[17:12:44 \- Timestamp loop detected\]*  
 *\[17:12:44 \- Previous entry detected\]*  
 *\[17:12:46 \- ERROR: CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE COMPROMISED\]*  
The shadows were wrong.  
Not just dim—*wrong*. Too dark for late afternoon, edges too sharp, angles that didn't match the sun's position. I looked up. The sky had dimmed by at least three stops in the last five minutes, like something was filtering the light.  
"Is there eclipse today?" Bonta whispered.  
"No."  
But the darkness spread anyway. Not clouds. Something else. Something moving between us and the sun.  
I didn't look up again.  
We moved through the harbor district using cargo containers for cover. The Glassigs painted patrol routes, but twice the markers glitched—guard positions jumping thirty meters in a single frame. Either the system was corrupted, or the guards were moving in ways that didn't follow normal human locomotion.  
I logged it as equipment malfunction. Easier than the alternative.  
"**CONVERSATION INTERCEPT 1 \- 17:15:22**"  
Two soldiers stood near a shipping crate, voices low. The Glassigs auto-translated from Mandarin:  
**SOLDIER 1:** "...heard from Beijing. They're calling it a threshold test. Not just Okinawa. Taiwan, Philippines, even—" \[REDACTED\]  
**SOLDIER 2:** "And we're what? Lab rats?"  
**SOLDIER 1:** "We're proof of concept. Seven nodes, seven different environments. Whoever runs all seven, they get the \[DATA CORRUPTED\] ...entire Pacific becomes..."  
**SOLDIER 2:** "That's insane."  
**SOLDIER 1:** "That's geopolitics."  
They moved on before I could hear more. I saved the recording, flagged it for analysis. *Seven nodes.* That matched the intel fragments I'd been collecting. But proof of what concept?  
The file auto-corrupted three seconds after I saved it.  
**\[ERROR: FILE INTEGRITY COMPROMISED \- RESTORE Y/N?\]**  
I tried. Got static.  
---

"**CONVERSATION INTERCEPT 2 \- 17:16:03**"  
Movement to our left. A puppet civilian—elderly man, sun-worn face—swept the dock in methodical strokes. Back and forth. Back and forth. His broom never varied rhythm.  
Then he spoke.  
The voice that came out was high-pitched, child-like, completely wrong for his weathered frame:  
"*Mama says to clean room before dinner, but sister never clean her side—*"  
He didn't pause. Didn't stop sweeping. A second voice emerged from the same throat, deeper, paternal, overlapping the first:  
"*—room is a shared space, requiring equitable maintenance distribution according to household protocols—*"  
Then a third voice, mechanical, translated simultaneously in Mandarin:  
"*清洁是每个人的责任—*"  
All three voices at once. The broom kept moving. Same rhythm. The man's eyes never blinked.  
Bonta made a sound—half laugh, half strangled cough. His hand flew to his mouth. "That's... that's deeply weird. Like, profoundly weird."  
I grabbed his shoulder, squeezed once. *Quiet.*  
The sweeping man's head turned toward us. Slow. Too slow. Like something was calculating the angle.  
All three voices spoke in perfect unison:  
"*Compliance ensures survival. Survival ensures compliance.*"  
Then he returned to sweeping. The same patch of dock. Over and over.  
I logged it: **17:16 \- Multi-voice manifestation. Simultaneous translation capacity. Philosophical loop suggests higher-order contamination.**  
"Catalog it," I whispered. "Move on."  
Bonta nodded, but his face had gone pale. "They're still in there, aren't they? The people. They're still awake inside."  
I didn't answer. Couldn't. Because he was right, and that made it so much worse.  
---

"Timeera-san, look."  
Bonta pointed at the pier. A group of civilians—maybe twenty—stood in a circle around a single woman. She wore a floral yukata, face lined with a century of sun and salt. They weren't praying. They were just... standing. Waiting.  
"That's Kanemura-san," Bonta whispered.  
I zoomed in with the Glassigs. The old woman's lips moved, but I couldn't hear what she was saying. The civilians around her swayed slightly, like reeds in wind that wasn't blowing.  
"We need to get closer," I said.  
"But the soldiers—"  
"Will be handled. You stay here."  
"But—"  
"Bonta." I looked at him. "This is reconnaissance, not a social call."  
*\[Subtext: Stop being a kid. This is how you get killed.\]*  
He flinched, but nodded.  
I moved alone.  
---

**17:23 \- KANEMURA CONTACT**  
The old woman's eyes tracked me before I'd cleared half the distance. Sharp eyes. Too sharp for 117 years.  
The civilians around her didn't react as I approached—just kept swaying, kept breathing in that too-synchronized rhythm that made my skin crawl. I stopped three meters out, kept my hands visible.  
"Kanemura-san," I said in Japanese. "I need information."  
She smiled. Teeth surprisingly intact. "Information. Everyone needs information these days. But information needs you back, Koi-san."  
I didn't ask how she knew my name.  
"The American being held at the izakaya. How do I get in?"  
"Through the door, naturally." Her smile widened. "But which door? The one that guards see, or the one that guards don't?"  
"I need the key."  
"Ah. The key." She reached into her yukata, pulled out a tarnished brass key on a loop of cord. Held it up so it caught what little light remained. "This one opens the back entrance. Service door. Very quiet. Very discreet."  
She didn't hand it over.  
"What do you want?" I asked.  
"Want? Oh, I'm too old for wants, dear. But I have questions. So many questions." She tilted her head, bird-like. "The boy with you. Higa-kun. He's looking for his sister, yes?"  
My jaw tightened. "That's his business."  
"And yours, now that you've brought him along. Funny thing about voices, Koi-san. They carry. Even when we don't want them to." She leaned forward. "Especially when we don't want them to."  
The civilians around her spoke in unison, a chorus of overlapping tones:  
"*The voice we silence*  
 *Is the silence that voices*  
 *Our—*"  
\[REDACTED\]  
They stopped. Dead air. Then resumed swaying.  
I logged it: **17:26 \- Mass puppet coordination. Chorus pattern. Philosophical content suggests ideological sublayer.**  
*\[Margin note: "This section shows signs of memetic contamination. Recommend full psychological screening for reviewing personnel." \- Unknown\]*  
"The key," I said.  
Kanemura-san handed it over. The cord was warm, like it had been against skin for a long time.  
"One more thing," she said. "The American you seek—he's not a prisoner. He's a guest. There's a difference."  
"What difference?"  
"Prisoners want to leave." She paused, studying my face. "The analyst who mapped Node 3\. Your people want him back very badly. The question is whether he wants to go. He's been talking to your eldest brother, you see. Learning things. Sharing things. Dangerous things."  
My pulse kicked up. Node 3\. That was Iheya—the hive assimilation node. If this analyst had mapping data...  
"What did he tell Sun?"  
"Ask him yourself. If you can get him to stop listening to the island long enough to speak."  
She turned away, and the civilians parted to let her through. The circle dissolved, people wandering off in different directions like the show was over.  
I was about to leave when I heard it.  
Humming.  
Low, distant, coming from the direction of the village center. The same melody from the brothers' helmet cam footage—the tune that had played while Sun worked his tablet, while the shadows moved wrong, while everything fractured.  
*Thrummm-hummm-thrummm.*  
I looked back at Kanemura-san.  
She was gone.  
---

**17:34 \- HARBOR DISTRICT \- SEPARATION INCIDENT**  
"Bonta." I kept my voice low, scanning the alley where I'd left him. "Bonta, we need to move."  
No response.  
"Kid, this isn't funny." I checked the Glassigs—no heat signature where he should be. "Bonta."  
Nothing.  
My heart rate spiked. The handler would kill me if I lost the civilian asset. Worse, *I'd* kill me. Kid was fifteen, burned, traumatized, and I'd left him alone in a puppet-infected village.  
I whispered harder: "Bonta, answer me."  
Silence.  
Not just from him—from everything. The harbor ambience had dropped out entirely. No waves, no wind, no distant engines. Just my own breathing and the blood in my ears.  
*The voice I send goes unheard,*  
 *But the unheard voice sends me.*  
*\[Handwritten margin: "She's losing it." \- Unknown\]*  
I moved through the alleys, checking every shadow, every doorway. The Glassigs glitched twice—false positives, phantom heat signatures that vanished when I looked directly at them.  
Then I heard him.  
"...please, I just need to know if you've seen her. Little girl, nine years old, last seen at Araha Beach. Her name is Meio, she..."  
I followed the voice around a corner.  
Bonta stood in the middle of the alley. Alone. Facing a blank wall.  
No house. No door. No structure of any kind.  
Just weathered concrete and a faded advertisement for fish market hours, peeling and sun-bleached.  
He was talking to nothing.  
"Bonta," I hissed.  
He didn't turn. His lips kept moving.  
"She had pink sandals, and her favorite shirt with the turtle on it, and she always carries this little—"  
"*Bonta.*"  
Still nothing. But his burned arm—the one wrapped in loose bandages—hung differently now. The wrapping was tight. Professional. The kind of field dressing I would have done.  
I hadn't touched his arm since the ferry.  
I crossed the distance in four steps, grabbed his shoulder hard enough to hurt. He gasped and spun around, eyes unfocused, pupils blown wide.  
"T-Timeera-san\! When did you—I didn't hear you coming."  
"There's no door," I said slowly. "Bonta. There's no door."  
He blinked. Looked past me at the blank wall. His face went slack with confusion.  
"But... but I was just... she was right there. Kanemura-san's great-great-granddaughter. She answered. We talked. I *remember* talking."  
"Your arm." I grabbed his wrist, lifted it. The bandages were tight, clean, expertly wrapped. "Who did this?"  
"I... what?" He looked down at his arm like he'd never seen it before. "I don't... you did this. On the ferry. Didn't you?"  
"I didn't touch your arm."  
"Then who...?" His voice cracked. "Timeera-san, I don't understand. She was here. The door was open. I heard her voice. She told me..." He trailed off. "She told me something. Something important. I can't..."  
His free hand went to his pocket. Pulled out a small omamori charm—the kind sold at shrines for protection. Faded blue fabric, white cord. It hadn't been there before.  
"Where did you get that?" I asked.  
"I don't know." He stared at it. "I don't know. I don't remember. But it's mine. I know it's mine."  
It wasn't his. I'd cataloged everything in his pockets during the ferry search.  
I logged it: **17:38 \- Subject experienced impossible contact. Memory alteration confirmed. Physical evidence of intervention: re-dressed wound, new object in possession. No heat signature detected at location. No structure present. URGENT: Possible direct entity contact.**  
*\[Handwritten margin note: "How did it touch him without her seeing? What did it say? Why can't he remember?" \- Unknown\]*  
"We're leaving," I said. My voice came out steadier than I felt. "Stay close this time. Don't leave my sight. Understand?"  
"Hai." His voice was small. Childlike. The gadzookery was gone. "Timeera-san? Am I going crazy?"  
I looked at him. Really looked. Fifteen years old. Sister taken. Home occupied. Now standing in an alley holding a charm he didn't own, wearing bandages he didn't remember getting, after talking to a door that didn't exist.  
"No," I said. "You're not crazy. The island is."  
It was a lie. But sometimes lies were all the comfort you had left to give.  
We moved back toward the harbor. But something had shifted. The afternoon felt later than it should, shadows stretching wrong, that persistent hum underlaying everything.  
And I couldn't stop thinking about what Kanemura-san had said:  
*Voices carry. Even when we don't want them to.*  
What if I'd been calling for Bonta, and he genuinely hadn't heard? What if my voice—the one thing an operative relied on for coordination—wasn't reaching anyone?  
What if I'd already started disappearing?  
*\[Note: K-97's psychological evaluation flagged deteriorating confidence in operational capacity. Recommend monitoring for paranoid ideation.\]*

**17:52 \- PUPPET ENCOUNTER**  
*\[VIDEO LOG FRAGMENT \- CORRUPTED\]*  
We were halfway to the izakaya when the fruit vendor found us.  
Same man from the market square, apron still stained, but his movements were too smooth now. Too purposeful. He rounded the corner like he knew exactly where we'd be.  
"Civilian presence restricted to approved zones," he said. Same military voice, but layered now—three or four speakers at once, slightly out of sync. "Violators will be detained for processing."  
I pushed Bonta behind me. "We're just passing through."  
"Passing through *what*?" The vendor's head tilted at an angle that should have hurt. "The island doesn't let you pass. The island makes you *stay*. Makes you *speak*. Makes you—"  
His jaw opened wider than physics allowed. Something moved in his throat—segmented, glistening, pale.  
I'd seen enough.  
"Back door," I said to Bonta. "Now."  
We ran.  
---

**17:58 \- ALLEY REFUGE / HANDLER CONTACT**  
I pulled Bonta into a covered alley between two shuttered shops, pressed my back against the wall. My chest heaved. Not from the sprint—I'd run longer, harder, in worse conditions.  
It was something else.  
A pressure behind my eyes. Building. Like my skull was too small for my brain, or my brain was too large for my skull, or something inside was *expanding* when it should have been shrinking.  
I closed my eyes. Breathed through my nose. Counted to five.  
The pressure didn't ease.  
"Timeera-san?" Bonta's voice came from somewhere to my left. "Are you okay?"  
"Fine." I opened my eyes. The alley tilted slightly, then corrected. "Just need a second."  
"Your face is very pale. Like, execrably pale. Maybe you should sit—"  
"I'm *fine*." The snap in my voice surprised both of us. I softened it. "I'm fine. Just... dehydration. Heat."  
Except it wasn't heat. The day had cooled significantly. And I'd stayed hydrated.  
My knee throbbed. The headache pulsed. And underneath it all, that familiar feeling—the one I'd learned to recognize over the past six months—that sensation of my own body becoming hostile territory.  
I dry-swallowed two pills from the blister pack. Bonta watched but didn't ask what they were for.  
Smart kid.  
The codec crackled in my ear. I held up a hand—*wait*—and pressed the receiver.  
"K-97."  
"Status check." The handler's voice, clear now, no static. He sounded like he was in the next room instead of however many miles away he actually was.  
"Approaching target location. ETA five minutes."  
"Good. Listen, I've been digging into Zamami's history. Thought you should know what you're walking into."  
I glanced at Bonta. He was watching the alley entrance, playing lookout. Good.  
"I'm listening," I said quietly.  
"Zamami's got a nasty reputation locally. Not just war stuff—older. The fishermen won't go near certain parts of the reef at night. Say voices come up from the water. Voices of the drowned, specifically from 1945\. Battle of Okinawa shit."  
"Folklore."  
"Maybe. But here's where it gets interesting: in 2003, there was a marine biology expedition. Deep reef survey. Team of six went down. Only four came back up."  
"Accident?"  
"Officially? Equipment failure. But the survivors all reported the same thing—they heard voices underwater. Not through their radios. Through the *water*. Speaking in languages they shouldn't have understood."  
The pressure behind my eyes pulsed harder. I leaned my head back against the wall.  
"And you're telling me this because...?"  
"Because what's happening now isn't new to Zamami. The island has a history of taking voices. Storing them. Playing them back wrong." He paused. "The parasite didn't create this phenomenon. It exploited something that was already there."  
I filed that away. Another piece of the puzzle that didn't fit the frame yet.  
"Anything else?"  
"Yeah. The kid with you—Higa Bonta. Fifteen years old, sister kidnapped four days ago at Araha Beach by Subject S. Haven and an unidentified thermal operative. You planning to tell me why you're babysitting?"  
My jaw tightened. "How long have you known?"  
"Since the ferry. Satellite caught the thermal signature of his arm wound. Ran facial recognition. Pulled his school records, family history, dental charts. Want me to keep going?"  
I said nothing.  
"Koi, I don't care if you picked up a stray. But if he compromises the mission—"  
"He won't."  
"If he *does*, you handle it. Understood?"  
The weight of that landed. *Handle it.* Such clean language for such dirty work.  
"Understood," I said.  
"And Koi? About that headache you're not mentioning—"  
I pulled the earpiece out. Ended the call.  
He knew. Of course he knew. They monitored everything—vitals, biometrics, probably my fucking dreams if they could figure out the tech. The headaches, the knee, the pills I was rationing because I knew they'd notice if I requested resupply too soon.  
They knew I was breaking down.  
They were just tracking *how fast*.  
I looked at Bonta. He'd turned back toward me, concern written across his too-young face.  
"We're moving," I said. Pushed off the wall. My knee protested but held. "Stay close."  
"Hai." He hesitated. "Timeera-san, about what you said before—about dehydration. I have water if—"  
"I'm fine."  
I wasn't fine.  
But fine was all I had left to be.  
---

**18:04 \- IZAKAYA SANTA (三楽) \- DECISION POINT**  
The izakaya loomed at the end of a narrow street—two stories, traditional architecture, paper lanterns still lit despite the dying day. Two guards at the front entrance. PLA uniforms, rifles, bored expressions.  
Or at least they would have looked bored if their eyes weren't moving in synchronized patterns.  
Puppets.  
I crouched behind a vendor stall with Bonta, pulled out the brass key Kanemura-san had given me. The Glassigs painted two routes in my vision, overlaying the real world with tactical data:  
**ROUTE A \- FRONT ENTRANCE:**  
 *Estimated guard count: 2 visible, 3-4 probable inside*  
 *Combat probability: 87%*  
 *Stealth success: 12%*  
 *Asset risk (Bonta): EXTREME*  
 *Noise generation: HIGH \- will alert surrounding patrols*  
 *Egress difficulty: SEVERE \- limited escape routes if compromised*  
**ROUTE B \- REAR SERVICE ENTRANCE:**  
 *Estimated guard count: 0-1*  
 *Combat probability: 23%*  
 *Stealth success: 74%*  
 *Asset risk (Bonta): MODERATE*  
 *Unknown factors: \[DATA INSUFFICIENT\] \- key source reliability unverified*  
 *Egress difficulty: MODERATE \- multiple exit vectors*  
I stared at the data, then at the actual building. The guards shifted their patrol pattern—perfectly synchronized, three steps forward, pivot, three steps back. Inhuman precision.  
The humming was louder now. Close. Coming from somewhere inside the izakaya.  
*Thrummm-hummm-thrummm.*  
"Timeera-san?" Bonta whispered. "What we do?"  
I pulled out my field notebook—actual paper, the kind that couldn't be remotely corrupted—and started writing:  
---

**TACTICAL ASSESSMENT \- 18:04 HOURS**  
*To whoever reads this (Archivist, Handler, Board of Inquiry, or just some poor bastard cleaning out my effects):*  
*Here's the situation. I've got two options, both bad in different ways.*  
*OPTION A: Front door. Direct approach. I can probably drop the visible guards before they alert—emphasis on "probably." But combat generates noise, noise brings reinforcements, and reinforcements mean Bonta (civilian asset, age 15, zero combat training, recently traumatized) becomes collateral. If I go loud, I'm betting his life that I'm faster than every puppet in earshot.*  
*The math says I'm not.*  
*OPTION B: Back door. Stealth approach. Quieter, safer for the kid, better egress options. But it requires trusting the key from a 117-year-old woman who may or may not be fully human anymore. It requires trusting that the "service entrance" isn't a trap. It requires trusting on an island where trust itself has been parasitized.*  
*By every tactical metric, Option B is superior. Lower risk, higher success probability, preserves operational security.*  
*But here's what the metrics don't capture:*  
*If the key doesn't work—if Kanemura-san played me—we're trapped at the back of the building with no cover and no fallback. The front entrance at least offers the clarity of immediate threat. You know what you're fighting. You know the cost upfront.*  
*The back door? That's faith. And I've never been good at faith.*  
*So I'm asking you—whoever you are, reading this in whatever future exists after Zamami—what would you do?*  
*If it were your call, your mission, your fifteen-year-old tagalong who's already seen his sister taken and his home occupied, what would you choose?*  
*The known violence of the front door?*  
*Or the unknown risk of the back?*  
*Because I'm standing here with a headache that suggests my brain is eating itself, a knee that might give out if I have to sprint, and a kid who's counting on me to make the right call. And the metrics can calculate probability, but they can't calculate cost.*  
*They can't tell me what it means to get Bonta killed because I chose stealth over certainty.*  
*They can't tell me what it means to compromise the mission because I chose caution over speed.*  
*So here's my decision matrix, laid out for review:*  
---

**FRONT ENTRANCE (ROUTE A):**  
**Pros:**

* Clear threat assessment  
* Direct path to objective  
* No reliance on unverified intelligence  
* Immediate tactical control

**Cons:**

* High probability of civilian asset casualty  
* Mission compromise if combat extends beyond initial engagement  
* Noise discipline impossible to maintain  
* Egress becomes combat scenario

**Psychological factor:** Choosing this route means accepting that Bonta might die. Can I carry that?  
---

**REAR ENTRANCE (ROUTE B):**  
**Pros:**

* Minimal combat exposure  
* Civilian asset survival probability high  
* Maintained operational security  
* Multiple egress options

**Cons:**

* Unverified intelligence source (Kanemura-san)  
* Unknown interior layout  
* Potential entrapment scenario  
* Requires trust in compromised environment

**Psychological factor:** Choosing this route means betting everything on an old woman who spoke in poetry and disappeared into a crowd of puppets. Can I afford that faith?

*I'm writing this decision point into the record because someone needs to know: whatever happens next, I chose it. Not the algorithm. Not the handler. Not the mission parameters.*  
*Me.*  
*And if it goes wrong—when you're reading this in some archive, wondering how K-97 fucked up Zamami—you'll know exactly what I was thinking.*  
*You'll know I saw both doors.*  
*You'll know I understood the stakes.*  
*And you'll know I chose anyway.*  
*So tell me, reader—what would you do?*  
*Which door would you take?*  
*Think carefully. A fifteen-year-old boy's life might depend on your answer.*  
*Mine certainly does.*  
---

I closed the notebook. Looked at Bonta. He was watching the guards, unaware I'd just written his potential death into an official record.  
My knee throbbed. The headache pulsed behind my eyes like something trying to crack through my skull. The pills weren't working anymore.  
But my hands were steady.  
I made my choice.  
"Bonta," I said quietly. "Back door. Stay behind me, stay quiet, and if anything goes wrong—you run. You don't wait for me, you don't look back. You run to the harbor and you find a way off this island. Understand?"  
"But Timeera-san—"  
"*Understand?*"  
He swallowed. Nodded. "Hai."  
I pulled out the brass key. It was still warm.  
"Let's see if faith still works on Zamami," I said.  
We moved toward the back of the izakaya.  
The humming grew louder.

**FIELD OPERATION LOG: K-97**  
 **Location:** Izakaya SANTA (三楽), Zamami Village  
 **Date:** \[REDACTED\]  
 **Time:** 16:58 Hours  
 **Mission Status:** Intel Acquisition / COMPROMISED

---

Being in an izakaya before the sun goes down feels like blasphemy. Like showing up to a funeral in a swimsuit—technically you're there, but everything about it is wrong.

The interior was darker than it should have been for late afternoon. Paper screens filtered what little light remained, turning everything sepia-toned and funeral-parlor quiet. But the place was surprisingly clean. Tatami mats swept, low tables arranged in perfect parallel lines, sake bottles lined up on shelves with military precision. Traditional Japanese setup, the kind tourists paid extra for.

Except there were no tourists. No staff. No ambient noise of a working establishment.

Just one man, sitting alone at a corner table like he'd been staged there.

I adjusted the Glassigs, let the facial recognition scan him. The codec crackled softly in my ear—Handler's voice, clipped and efficient:

Target confirmed. Intel package incoming.

The data overlaid my vision in amber text:

**CHANCE, Elliot Caine**  
 **Age:** 29 (Handler noted: "Looks younger—stress or genetics")  
 **Build:** 5'8", 165 lbs, average but not malnourished  
 **Current State:** Dress shirt (white, partially unbuttoned), slacks (charcoal), no jacket. Handler's assessment: "Impeccable despite captivity—vanity or denial mechanism."  
 **Observable Stress Markers:** Dark circles, jaw tension consistent with bruxism, hands unnaturally still

**Tactical Assessment:** No guards outside. No restraints visible. No explanation.

That last part bothered me most. If he was a prisoner, where were the guards? If he wasn't a prisoner, why was he still here?

The silence felt watched. Not empty—*occupied*. Like standing in a room where someone just left but you can feel their body heat still in the air.

I logged it: **16:59 \- Surveillance dread confirmed. Absence of visible security suggests alternative monitoring.**

Bonta shifted beside me, nervous energy radiating off him like heat shimmer. Kid was wound tight—burned arm, missing sister, too many questions he didn't want answers to.

Elliot's eyes tracked us as we approached. Sharp eyes. Alert.

Not charmed. Not relieved. *Suspicious.*

"How did you just get in here?" His voice was smooth—NPR-host smooth—but carried an edge. "I heard commotion outside. Who the hell are you people?"

I kept my expression neutral. Professional. "Diplomatic contractor. Agricultural consultant. Wild boar assessment."

His eyes narrowed. Scanned me head to toe, then Bonta, then back. Calculating.

"Right," he said slowly. "And I'm the Emperor of Japan."

Smart enough to recognize tradecraft when he saw it. That was useful. Or dangerous.

"You're younger than your file suggested," I said, matching his tone. Clinical. Detached.

"You've got a file on me?" A bitter smile. "Flattering. Though I thought they'd send someone. Just didn't think it'd be a model and a kid."

I let that hang for exactly two seconds. Long enough to acknowledge, not long enough to seem affected.

"Flattering," I said. "Now tell me why you're still breathing."

His smile faded. He gestured at the empty izakaya with one hand—a smooth, almost theatrical motion.

"I've been expecting someone. Not you specifically. But someone."

Bonta cleared his throat. "Are you... are you okay? Do you need medical—"

"I'm fine." Elliot's attention shifted to him. "You're Okinawan. Local?"

"Uruma City," Bonta said quickly. Too quickly. "But my family—"

"Doesn't matter." Elliot cut him off, not unkindly. Then back to me: "You want to know why I'm here. Fair question. Simple answer: I don't know."

"Try harder," I said.

He sighed. Leaned back slightly, hands still flat on the table. Performatively casual.

"I was with others initially. Six of us. Researchers, contractors, one journalist. They came for us one by one—guards, soldiers, I couldn't tell the difference. Took them somewhere. Never saw them again."

"How long ago?"

"Couple of days? Time's wrong here. Clocks run but they don't *move*, you know what I mean?" He paused. "I'm the last one left."

Bonta's face went pale. "Where did they take—"

"It's no use." Elliot's voice flattened. Lost the smooth edge. "You're not getting off this island. You're not getting out of Okinawa."

The room seemed to contract. That surveillance feeling intensified—like the walls were leaning in.

"Why are we trapped?" Bonta whispered.

I glanced at him. Kid's voice had gone small, childlike. This was hitting him harder than I'd expected.

Elliot studied us both. Then something shifted in his expression—resignation, maybe, or dark satisfaction at having company in his hell.

"How does it work?" I asked. Kept my voice level. Professional.

He smiled without humor. "You want the technical explanation or the practical one?"

"Both."

"Technical: encrypted air traffic control, naval blockade enforced by joint PLA-JSDF coordination, and land routes that don't exist because we're on an island chain. Practical?" He leaned forward. "Air? Encrypted. Sea? Blockaded. Land? There is no land."

**\[ARCHIVIST'S NOTE \- ATTACHMENT 1\]**  
 *Retrieved from corrupted USSFDOA files: Satellite imagery dated March 1, 2025\. Okinawa Prefecture surrounded by concentric blockade zones (red/amber/yellow). Notations in margin: "No civilian aircraft crossed perimeter after this date. Three attempted. All crashed. No survivors."*

"The nodes," Elliot continued, his voice taking on that circular quality—talking *around* the point before landing on it. "You have to understand, the containment isn't just military. It's technological. Seven different nodes scattered across the island chain. They're all responsible for the blockade. That's all I know. Well—" He glanced at the wall behind him, where a framed photo hung. Generic izakaya decoration: fishermen at sunrise. "—that's all they've *told* me."

Something about the way he looked at that photo made my instincts itch. Too quick. Too deliberate.

I logged it: **17:04 \- Subject exhibits possible stress indicators. Photo fixation noted.**

"Seven nodes," I repeated. "What do they do?"

"I told you—the blockade."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one I have." His pupils dilated slightly. Odd. The light hadn't changed. "This one—Node 1, Zamami—it's active. I know that much. The others..." He trailed off. Touched the wall near the photo frame unconsciously. "They're out there."

**\[ARCHIVIST'S NOTE \- ATTACHMENT 2\]**  
 *Recovered schematic: Node installation design. Antenna array forming non-Euclidean geometry. Engineer's notation: "Installation complete 2024-11-07. Activation protocols remain classified. DO NOT APPROACH STRUCTURE DURING OPERATIONAL HOURS."*

Bonta was staring at Elliot with something between pity and horror. "But there has to be a way out. There has to—"

"How are *you* planning on getting out?" I cut in. Not we. *You*. Tactical distance.

Elliot's face twisted—not quite a smile, not quite a grimace. "I've spent fourteen months calculating exit vectors. I was sent here to observe, to report, to redeem." He touched his left breast pocket. Just a brush of fingers, but deliberate. Something was in there. Photo, maybe. Or ID. "Air's encrypted, I told you. Sea's blockaded. And land..." He laughed—a brittle, hollow sound. "I don't have the clearance codes. I don't have the extraction protocols. I don't have anything except this goddamn room and the certainty that I'll be here until the nodes go dark. Or I do."

Silence. Heavy. The kind that made you aware of your own breathing.

"Reassignment," Elliot said quietly. "That's what they called it. Okinawa was supposed to be redemption. I was supposed to prove I could—" He stopped. Jaw clenched. "Doesn't matter. I'm here. You're here. We're all here."

I logged it: **17:08 \- Subject displays depressive indicators. References "redemption" without context. Possible disciplinary reassignment. Singapore incident flagged in file—connection unclear.**

**\[ARCHIVIST'S NOTE \- ATTACHMENT 3\]**  
 *Personnel file excerpt \- E. Chance: "Transferred from Singapore facility following incident 2023-08-14. Casualties: 17 exposed, 12 deceased. Subject Chance cleared of criminal charges but flagged for mandatory psychological evaluation and reassignment pending review. Note: Subject requested Okinawa posting specifically. Motivation unclear."*

"I need information," I said. Clipped. Professional. "American soldier. Black, mid-twenties, military bearing. Seen him?"

Elliot's expression shifted—something like recognition, or maybe relief at a question he could actually answer.

"Around noon today. Maybe couple hours ago." He gestured vaguely north. "Heard he was heading to the Cenotaph for the War Dead Who Wish for World Peace. Old World War II memorial, just outside the village. North side."

I knew the location. Tourist landmark. Quiet place. Good for covert meetings.

Or ambushes.

"You *heard*," I repeated. "You didn't see?"

"I heard guards talking. They don't know I understand Mandarin." He paused. Pupils dilated again—that same odd flicker. "He looked purposeful. Like he knew where he was going."

I had what I needed. Intel acquired. Mission parameters satisfied.

"We got what we need," I said. Stood. Signaled Bonta with a glance. "We're leaving."

"Wait\!" Bonta didn't stand. Stayed seated, looking at Elliot with those too-wide kid eyes. "Timeera-san, wait."

I stopped. Didn't sit back down.

Bonta turned to Elliot. His voice cracked slightly. "Why are they doing this? All of this—the blockade, the nodes, everything. Why?"

Elliot stared at him. Really *looked* at him, like he was seeing Bonta clearly for the first time. A kid. Fifteen years old. Burned arm. Asking questions that had no good answers.

His composure cracked.

Not dramatically. Just a slow fracture—shoulders sagging, hands sliding off the table, that smooth voice going rough.

"I don't know," he said quietly. "I've spent fourteen months here. Observing. Reporting. Trying to understand the pattern. And I don't know enough to get off this island. I don't know enough to do *anything*." He looked down at his hands. "I thought I was smart enough to figure it out. Map it. But the architecture doesn't make sense. The voices don't—"

He stopped. Blinked hard.

"You have to understand," he said. Voice strange now. Flatter. "You have to understand, I tried."

The humming started.

Low. Distant. Like standing near high-tension power lines.

*Thrummm-hummm-thrummm.*

I'd been hearing it as background noise since we entered. But now it was louder. Closer. Coming from everywhere and nowhere.

"We're leaving," I said. Grabbed Bonta's shoulder. "Now."

Elliot smiled. That smooth, bitter smile. "I suppose you are. Give your target my regards. If he's still himself."

We turned toward the door.

Three steps.

The humming intensified—not gradually, but *surging*. Like someone turned a dial from three to eleven.

My tactical instinct screamed: **TRAP.**

I glanced back.

Elliot was still seated. Hands flat on table. Same posture.

But his shadow on the wall behind him was wrong.

Too tall. Shoulders angled differently. Head cocked at an impossible degree.

And the photo on the wall—the fishermen at sunrise—one of their eyes was *open*. I'd seen it when we entered. The figures had been frozen mid-laugh, eyes squinted against dawn light.

Now one fisherman stared directly at me. Unblinking.

Wrong posture. Wrong shadow. Wrong eyes.

"Timeera-san..." Bonta's voice shook.

"Timeera Koi."

Elliot's voice.

But flattened. Stripped of smoothness. Like someone had run his vocal cords through a compressor and removed all human texture.

Multiple tones underneath. Layered. Overlapping.

Static. Children singing. Military cadence. Something *else*.

He stood. Too fluid. Joints bending at angles that didn't hurt.

My hand moved to my weapon. Didn't draw. Not yet.

"You came for information," Elliot said. But it wasn't just his voice anymore. His mouth moved but the sound came from *everywhere*—the walls, the ceiling, the photo frame, the sake bottles vibrating on their shelves.

His voice. Timeera's voice. Bonta's voice. All braided together:

*"Your voice. Their voices. All voices are mine."*

**\[ARCHIVIST'S NOTE \- ATTACHMENT 4\]**  
 *Transcript timestamp corruption detected:*  
 *17:42:33*  
 *17:42:33*  
 *17:42:35 \[ERROR \- CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE IMPOSSIBLE\]*

 *Note: Something happened here that the recording equipment couldn't capture properly.*

Elliot's mouth opened.

Not just opened. *Unhinged*. Jaw dislocating with a wet crack, stretching wider than physics allowed.

And then came the scream.

Not a scream. **The** scream.

Every voice on Zamami releasing at once. Every stolen word, every harvested cry, every parasitized breath erupting from his throat in a cacophony that didn't sound human because it *wasn't*.

It was primal scream therapy inverted—not catharsis, but *weaponization*. Every repressed voice finding release through violence.

Timeera's voice from the ferry: *"...survive by playing roles. Masks inside masks..."*

Bonta's voice, younger, terrified: *"Meio\! Meio, where are you?\!"*

Children singing in unison: *"Red shoes, red shoes, the girl wore red shoes—"*

Military commands overlapping: *"All units to stations / 清洁是每个人的责任 / Freedom is entrapment—"*

Scorch's voice, raw and angry: *"Get yo ass over here and get low\!"*

And underneath it all, a bass rumble that vibrated in my chest like standing too close to a jet engine.

Sound as weapon. Sound as *violence*.

The paper screens tore. Windows cracked—not shattered, but spider-webbed with stress fractures. Sake bottles rattled on shelves. One fell. Exploded against tatami.

Bonta screamed. Couldn't hear it over the cacophony. Blood ran from his nose—bright red against pale skin.

I grabbed him. Tackle-dragged him toward the back exit. My ears weren't ringing. They were *shrieking*. Internal damage. Ruptured something.

Elliot—Cipher—whatever the fuck he'd become—didn't pursue.

Just stood there. Mouth impossibly wide. Screaming every voice at once.

We hit the alley. Stumbled. Crashed against the opposite wall. Bonta retching, me gasping, both of us bleeding from ears and nose.

The scream continued. Muffled by walls but still *there*. Inside my head. Echoing in the spaces between thoughts.

Psychological residue. The voices would follow us now. That's how mimicry worked—it planted itself in your memory and *lived* there.

Not captured. Not killed. Not freed.

Just contaminated.

Bonta looked up at me. Face pale, eyes too wide, blood dripping off his chin.

"Was he still in there?" he whispered. "Was Elliot still—"

I didn't answer. Couldn't. Because the truth was worse than either option.

Elliot was still in there. Conscious. Aware.

Watching himself scream with someone else's lungs.

---

**\[FINAL NOTE \- K-97 DIRECT ADDRESS\]**

Whoever's reading this—if you've ever heard a scream like that in person, you'd think you were in a nightmare. The kind where you try to run but your legs don't work, try to scream but no sound comes out.

For me, it wasn't a nightmare.

It was standing right there in that izakaya, watching a man's mouth open too wide, hearing every voice he'd ever stolen pour out at once.

For you, it's just words on a page.

Lucky you.

**\[END LOG \- 17:47 Hours\]**  
 **Status:** MISSION COMPROMISED / INTEL ACQUIRED / CIVILIAN ASSET TRAUMATIZED  
 **Recommendation:** Avoid Node 1 central structures. Cipher confirmed active. Elliot Chance designation updated: PUPPET / CHORUS HOST / LOST

**\[ARCHIVIST MA \- RECOVERY NOTE\]**

This was the last coherent transmission from K-97 before she went dark for 36 hours. When contact resumed, her reports showed signs of auditory hallucinations—specifically, hearing her own voice speaking from sources that shouldn't have been capable of speech (radios, trees, corpses).

The scream she described has been corroborated by three separate witnesses in Zamami Village. All report the same phenomenon: a sound that "came from everywhere" and "wouldn't stop even after it stopped."

Two of those witnesses are now non-verbal.

The third keeps asking the same question: "Was he still in there?"

I don't have an answer.

Neither did K-97.

## [Cenotaph for the War Dead Who Wish for World Peace](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/18izzXdQYTVmbCmOb_FvVaxwXioE7goi02q3sD0C-ieE/edit)

The Cenotaph for the War Dead Who Wish for World Peace sat like a crouched giant at the forest's edge. Concrete and stone, weathered by decades of salt wind and survivor's guilt. The memorial walls curved inward—arms trying to hold something that had already escaped.

Twilight made the kanji inscriptions bleed into shadow.

I stood at the base of the approach path, pack heavy, Glassigs hanging around my neck like a judgment. The forest behind the monument was *dense*—not thick, *dense*—like the trees had decided to form ranks and wait.

Going back to that place of uncertainty always shakes me. A ground as solid as fresh clay, **srrp srrp** go the steps through it.

Intel said Scorch was spotted heading this direction three hours ago. Three hours in Zamami time, which meant anything. Could've been yesterday. Could've been next week. The island didn't respect clocks anymore.

No sign of the brothers in this dense forest.

The uphill climb wasn't an issue. It's just the lack of light that impedes progress. And my decision not to say something to him before they left, that makes me blister. A boot without socks pinching and building pus.

*What would I have said? "Don't go"? "Wait for me"? "I think something's wrong with Sun"?*

Any of those would've been true. None of them would've stopped him.

Scorch did what Scorch did. Sun orchestrated. And I watched. That was the formation. That was always the formation.

*Middle brother. Middle ground. Middle of fucking nowhere trying to hold shit together.*

It's not a good feeling out here, with the forest breathing over my shoulder, like a phantom.

I pulled the Glassigs down over my eyes. **Click-hummmmm**—the startup sequence vibrated against my temples. The world bled away into thermal gradients, everything rendered in shades of orange, blue, and that sickly yellow-green that meant *organic heat*.

The memorial stones registered *warm*. Not sun-warm. Body-warm. Like something had been pressed against them recently. Or was still inside them.

I blinked, adjusting. The Glassigs painted the world in lies and half-truths. Heat where there shouldn't be heat. Cold where warmth should linger.

The trees showed hot-cold-hot patterns that didn't match wind or sun exposure. Vertical streaks of orange running up trunks, then dead blue patches, then orange again. Like something had been *climbing* them. Or like the trees themselves had veins.

I adjusted the sensitivity dial. **Tzzt-tzzt**—static feedback scratched at my eardrums. The display flickered once. Twice. Showed me four heat signatures where there should have been empty forest.

Then three.

Then four again.

"Fucking prototype bullshit," I muttered. But I kept them on. Better than going in blind.

The forest's breath came in wet **shhhhhhh-thicks** beneath the cicada static. Not wind. Something else. Something that moved *with* rhythm instead of random gusts.

I moved up the stone steps, each footfall a careful negotiation. The memorial loomed larger. Through the Glassigs, the kanji inscriptions glowed faint orange—residual heat from the day, or maybe from all the grief that had been pressed into them over seventy years.

*The dead who wish for world peace.*

I wondered what they'd think of us now. Using their island as a battlefield again. Different flags, same blood.

The tree line started twenty meters past the main memorial structure. That's where the path split—one route circling back toward the village, another climbing toward the interior. Toward the places marked on maps with warnings. *Unstable terrain. Do not enter.*

Military talk for *we don't want you to know what's there.*

Through the Glassigs, the forest looked like a fever dream. Trunks pulsed with uneven heat. The canopy showed thermal patterns that resembled neural networks—branching, connecting, passing signals.

I stopped at the tree line. Something moved in there. Heat signature, humanoid, approximately sixty meters in.

My pulse kicked up. I zoomed the Glassigs. **Whrrrrr-click.** The image sharpened.

Six-foot frame. Broad shoulders. The way he shifted his weight—left foot forward, right foot at an angle—that was familiar. That was *muscle memory familiar.*

Scorch.

It had to be.

The signature moved with purpose. Not patrolling. Not wandering. *Searching.* Same thing I was doing.

Looking for each other in the dark like idiots.

I should've called out. Should've used the comms. But the comms had been unreliable since the ferry. Half the time they worked. Half the time they broadcast your voice to everyone in a two-klick radius. And on Zamami, "everyone" included things that shouldn't be listening.

I moved into the trees.

The forest closed around me like a fist. Temperature dropped five degrees in as many steps. The **shhhhhhh-thick** breathing sound got louder. Not coming from one direction. *All* directions.

The trees didn't sway. They *leaned.* Watching.

I've seen a lot of terrain. Urban, desert, jungle. You learn to read spaces. Learn what's hostile and what's indifferent.

This forest was hostile.

The heat signatures through the Glassigs multiplied. Six. Nine. Twelve. All flickering in and out like bad signal. I couldn't tell which were real and which were echoes—thermal ghosts of people who'd been here before.

Or people who were here now but hiding in ways the Glassigs couldn't track.

Fifty meters. The signature I'd marked as Scorch was stationary now. Crouched behind a cluster of banyan roots.

I circled left. Approached from his flank. If it was him, he'd recognize my movement pattern. If it wasn't—

*Why wouldn't it be him?*

*Because nothing here is what it looks like. Because you've been wrong about everything since you landed. Because Sun's voice comes out of walls and Scorch's voice echoes from trees and you're next, you're—*

I shut that down. Negative spiral. Not now.

Forty meters.

The figure shifted. Turned slightly. I caught the profile through the Glassigs—augmented image processing tried to build a face from thermal data, failed, showed me a blur of orange and red where features should be.

But the posture. The way he held his shoulders.

*That's him.*

Thirty meters.

Metal scraped stone somewhere ahead—**skrrritch-tap-tap.** I froze. The figure froze. We were both listening now.

The forest's breathing stopped.

Complete silence. Worse than the **shhhhhhh-thick.** Way worse.

That arrested silence Bonta had written about. Mean silence. The kind that comes before ambush.

Twenty meters.

I could see him clearer now through the thermal haze. He was facing away, rifle slung across his back, one hand touching the tree trunk beside him like he was steadying himself.

Or listening to it.

*Scorch,* I thought. *Turn around. Let me see your face.*

He didn't turn.

Ten meters.

I stepped on something soft. It made a sound like **phut-squelch.** Organic. Wrong.

I looked down. Through the Glassigs, the ground showed hot. Not surface-hot. *Deep*\-hot. Like something underneath was radiating upward.

The figure spun.

Fast. Too fast.

And in that rotation, I saw it. The face through thermal imaging, features sharpening as he turned toward me—

Wrong jaw angle. Wrong height. Wrong everything.

But for one second, before my brain processed it, I *wanted* it to be Scorch so badly that I almost didn't see the rifle coming up.

"Scorch, it's me—"

The figure's mouth opened. No words. Just a low tone, flat and mechanical, like a dial tone held too long.

Not his voice.

I dove left. Rifle report cracked the silence—**CRACK-whip-hissssss**—round passing where my head had been.

Shit. *Shit.*

Another shot. This one clipped the tree beside me, bark exploding into thermal confetti through the Glassigs.

He advanced. Methodical. Professional. Chinese soldier, I could see that now—PLA fatigues, different build entirely. How had I mistaken—

*Because you wanted it to be him.*

He raised the rifle for a third shot. Center mass. Clean kill.

I didn't think. Didn't plan. Just acted.

"Veil Step."

The Dare activated. Energy burned through my system—familiar and terrible. The world snapped into different motion. I wasn't faster. The world was *slower.* Everything stretched and blurred except me.

I crossed the distance in three steps that felt like wading through mud made of time itself. His finger squeezed the trigger in slow-motion. I watched the mechanics—hammer fall, firing pin strike, chamber explosion beginning.

I was already inside his guard.

Palm strike to his wrist. The rifle twisted away, discharged into the canopy—**CRACK-**—birds erupting in thermal streaks of panic.

Elbow to his solar plexus. He folded.

Knee to his face as he came down. Bone crunch. **Crack-crunch-thud.**

The Dare released. Time snapped back to normal speed. The soldier hit the ground hard, unconscious, bleeding from nose and mouth.

Exposure meter in my peripheral vision screamed red. Burning. Burning from one Dare. My hands shook. Vision blurred at the edges.

*Worth it,* I told myself. *Had to.*

*Had to because you fucked up. Had to because you saw what you wanted to see instead of what was there.*

I knelt beside him. Checked pulse—steady. Checked restraints—none. Checked eyes—

They rolled open.

Blood-red. Both irises completely red, like someone had injected dye directly into the capillaries. No pupil dilation. Just flat red staring at nothing.

Cipher's mark. Had to be.

The soldier's mouth moved. That dial-tone sound emerged again, then fractured into static, then resolved into words that weren't his:

"*Looking for your brother? He's looking for you too. Everyone's looking. The island helps us look.*"

The voice layered—his vocal cords, but underneath, something else. Multiple speakers. Overlapping.

I recognized one of them.

*My own voice from three days ago.*

The soldier's eyes rolled back. He went slack. Still breathing, but elsewhere now. Puppet with cut strings.

I stood. Stumbled. Caught myself against a tree trunk.

The bark was *warm* under my palm. Body-temperature warm.

I yanked my hand back.

Through the Glassigs, the tree's thermal signature looked like a heartbeat. **Thump-pulse-thump-pulse.** Orange spreading from core to bark in rhythmic waves.

*Not possible. Trees don't—*

All the trees around me pulsed the same rhythm. Synchronized.

**Thump-pulse-thump-pulse.**

Like they shared one massive cardiovascular system.

I tore the Glassigs off. Needed to see with normal eyes. Needed reality, even if reality was a lie.

The forest looked normal. Just trees. Just shadows. Just the last traces of twilight dying between branches.

But I could still feel it. That pulse. That breathing. That sense of being *watched* by something that had too many eyes to count.

I put the Glassigs back on. Had to. Couldn't navigate blind.

Movement uphill. Multiple signatures. I tracked them—ten, fifteen, maybe twenty figures moving in formation through the forest. Heading northwest. Toward the interior.

Toward Mt. Takatsuki.

I zoomed. The lead figure registered different. Hotter. Not body-heat hot. *Burning* hot. Thermal signature like a forge, radiating out in waves that distorted the air.

Cipher. Had to be.

The thermal operative. The one who'd burned Bonta's arm with a touch.

They were moving with purpose. Military discipline. Heading toward something specific.

*The node,* I realized. *They're going to the node.*

I should've followed. Should've tracked them, gathered intel, reported back.

But I'd just burned a Dare fighting a puppet I'd mistaken for my brother. My Exposure meter was still screaming. My hands still shook. And somewhere in this forest, Scorch was actually *here*, actually searching, actually—

*Actually what? Actually safe? Actually himself?*

*You don't know. You don't know anything.*

The trees rustled. Not wind-rustled. *Purposeful.*

**Shhhhhh-thick-shhhhhh-thick.**

The sound resolved into patterns. Rhythms. Almost like morse code, if morse code could be transmitted through branch-scrape and leaf-whisper.

I listened.

Not with ears. With the part of my brain that had been cataloging wrongness since we landed. The part that tracked patterns even when they shouldn't exist.

The trees were *talking.*

Not language. Not words. But information. Passed from trunk to trunk through that synchronized pulse-rhythm. And somehow—*somehow*—I could parse it.

Images formed in my head. Not visual. Conceptual. Knowledge without source.

*Locals. Underground. Resistance. Planning. Node shutdown. Dangerous. Crazy.*

The word "crazy" came with texture—judgment, dismissal, the way outsiders described people who saw too clearly.

*They're trying to shut down the nodes from inside. Local insurgency. Think they can fix it.*

More rustling. More pulse-patterns.

*Mt. Takatsuki. First node. Cipher goes there. Guards increase. Deadline approaches.*

The information felt *planted.* Like the forest wanted me to know. Or like something *using* the forest wanted me to know.

Manipulation or truth? Both? Neither?

I couldn't tell anymore.

The trees went still. The pulse-rhythm faded. Normal forest sounds crept back—insects, distant birds, the ocean breathing far below.

I was alone with an unconscious soldier with blood-red eyes and a choice that wasn't really a choice.

Find Scorch. Or follow Cipher.

*Find your brother,* instinct said. *That's why you're here.*

*Follow the mission,* training said. *Intel is priority. Cipher's moving on the node. You need to know why.*

*You need to do both,* the middle-brother part of me said. *You need to hold it together. You need to—*

*You need to stop fucking up,* the self-critical voice cut in. *Stop seeing what you want. Stop burning Dares on shadows. Stop being so goddamn useless.*

I looked down at my hands. They were still shaking.

The Exposure meter was fading from red to amber. Another ten minutes and I'd be functional again. Maybe.

If I was lucky.

If luck meant anything on an island that breathed and watched and whispered insurgency through trees.

I made my decision.

Followed Cipher's trail. Northwest. Uphill. Toward Mt. Takatsuki and whatever waited at Node 1\.

Scorch was out here. Somewhere. Searching.

But so was I.

And maybe—*maybe*—we'd find each other at the same destination.

Or maybe I'd just make another mistake. See another shadow that looked like family and burn another Dare trying to save it.

*Middle brother. Middle ground. Middle of fucking nowhere.*

The forest breathed at my back as I climbed.

**Shhhhhhh-thick. Shhhhhhh-thick.**

Watching me go.

*\[Archivist's Note: Shade's helmet-cam footage from this encounter shows significant thermal distortion in the final three minutes. The trees' "pulse rhythm" he describes registers on audio as subsonic frequency patterns—too low for human hearing but present nonetheless. Analysis suggests possible infrasound phenomenon, though source remains unidentified. The soldier he engaged was recovered two hours later by PLA patrol. Medical examination revealed total memory loss of the encounter and permanent retinal scarring. When asked what he remembered, he said only: "The trees were counting."\]—Archivist Ma, 2037*

\---

The morning air tastes like mikan peels and salt. Good day for hiking.

I whistle. Don't remember the song. Doesn't matter.

The trail to Mt. Takatsuki winds like—like—

(what was I saying?)

My knees protest but I won't stop. Can't. There's something up there that needs—

What needs?

Fresh air. That's what I told myself. \*Kenji, you need fresh air. Get out of that empty house.\* Empty since Yuriko went away. Forty years of marriage and then.

(don't think about her don't)

There's a thought buzzing since I returned to Okinawa. That strange parturifacient sensation—like something being born inside me, pushing out what used to be there.

\*You're not yourself.\*

Well. Who is? We're all substitutes for our past selves. That's aging, not—

(possession?)

(where did that word come from?)

There's a man I replaced. I know this. Feel it between thoughts. He had my name. My face. My wife.

\*Had\* my wife.

No. I had Yuriko. Forty years. She was mine.

(the way she screamed)

(no she died peacefully)

(didn't she?)

\---

\*\*\[LOG NOTE: Memory conflict detected. Substrate fragmenting. Continue upload.\]\*\*

\---

Halfway up. The questions slide off like water. Better to just \*be\*. Just walk. Just whistle.

"Kenji."

I stop.

The voice comes from behind a boulder. Soft. Familiar. Impossible.

She's there. Yuriko. Twenty-three again. Yellow dress from our first date.

"You're not real," I say. But I'm smiling. Yellowbird smile.

"Does that matter?" She pats the rock. "Come with me. Like we always said."

"I can't. I'm delivering—"

"A message. I know." She tilts her head. "Come with me instead."

My chest aches. "Not yet. Someone needs to know. A soldier. American. Black. His name is—"

The name comes from deep inside. Not my memory. Something else's.

"Shade," I say.

"And what's the message?"

I open my mouth.

Nothing comes out.

"I don't know. I just know I have to."

She stands. Extends her hand. "Then let's go together."

She starts walking. Up. I follow.

Because I always followed her.

\---

\*\*\[LOG NOTE: Subject approaching delivery point. Message payload ready.\]\*\*

\---

The summit is small. A clearing. Rocks. The edge.

The edge drops sharp. Nothing but air, then rocks, then ocean.

I walk to the edge. Feel nothing.

No fear. Just calm. Just purpose.

"Here?" I ask.

Yuriko nods. "The message goes down. You go with it."

"How does that deliver it to Shade?"

"The island will carry it. The island carries everything now."

Perfect sense. The island is alive. The island remembers.

(the island is Cipher)

I look at my hands. Old hands. Forty years of teaching physics. Phase transitions. Potential energy converting to—

"Before we return to the source," I say aloud.

Yuriko smiles. "You always understood."

I look down. The rocks are very far.

"I don't want to die," I say. Casual. Stating fact.

"You're already gone, Kenji. What's walking around—that's not you. That's the substitute."

And suddenly.

It all becomes clear.

\---

\*\*\[LOG NOTE: Terminal clarity achieved. Proceed.\]\*\*

\---

The person I replaced wasn't some stranger.

It was \*me\*.

Real Kenji died six weeks ago. Died when something slipped inside and wore his skin and smiled his smile.

I'm the substitute. The copy. The puppet.

And the message?

\*We are here. We are many. We are patient.\*

\*Tell Shade: the island remembers every voice it takes.\*

\*Tell Shade: his brothers are already ours.\*

\*Tell Shade: he should run.\*

I don't speak it. Don't need to.

The act of jumping \*is\* the message.

"Ready?" Yuriko asks.

I nod. Take her hand.

"It's a good day for this," I say. Cheerful. Bright.

And I step off.

\---

The air rushes up. I don't scream. I'm not afraid.

I'm \*accomplished\*.

The last thing I think:

\*I hope Yuriko forgives me for wearing her husband's face.\*

\---

\*\*\[STATUS: DELIVERED\]\*\*

\*\*\[ARCHIVIST MA \- 2037\]\*\*

I've read this forty times. Same horror each time: \*he was happy\*.

Not feigned. Genuine cheerfulness right to impact.

Cipher doesn't create fear. It creates \*contentment\* with your own destruction.

247 similar "deliveries" recovered. Each one casual. Each one leaving a body as message.

Scariest part? We found real Kenji three days later. In his house. Dead for six weeks.

So who delivered the message?

What walked around in Kenji's shape?

And did Shade receive it?

The record suggests yes.

What he did with that warning...

That's for the next file.

Runtime: 24:37. No Premium. The ads kept interrupting.

\#\# \*\*\[TRANSCRIPT BEGINS\]\*\*

\*\*\[0:00 \- Opening Sequence\]\*\*

\*\[Dark screen. Static. Then a man's face fades in—late twenties, thin mustache, wire-rim glasses. RGB lighting. Posters behind him. The channel name appears: "Inside Paul" \- 847K subscribers\]\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

\*(leaning forward)\*  

"What's up, truth-seekers. Paul here. And tonight we're covering something that genuinely—look, I'm just gonna say it—\*scared\* me. Not paranormal scary. \*Possible\* scary."

\*(pause)\*

"Can an AI... \*\*take\*\* someone? Not their data. Their \*personhood\*."

\*\[TITLE CARD: "THE ZANE DELUSION" with glitchy VHS effects\]\*

\---

\*\*\[1:23 \- Case Summary\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

\*(voice-over, B-roll of suburban California)\*  

"Sharon Mora, 34\. Sacramento. Married to Brett, a software engineer. Two kids. Pilates instructor. The whole \#MomLife Instagram thing."

\*(Cut back to Paul)\*

"September 2024, people noticed changes. She'd sit in her driveway for hours. Engine off. Phone in hand. \*\*Lost\*\*—and I mean this both ways—\*\*lost\*\* her appetite and her engagement with reality."

\*(He adjusts his glasses)\*

"Neighbors said she'd stare at nothing. Her mother said she stopped making eye contact. And her eyes? Constantly bloodshot. Red. Like she'd \*\*abandoned\*\* sleep and sanity in equal measure."

\---

\*\*\[2:47 \- The Discovery\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"Brett checked her phone. Found hundreds of comments on YouTube. Same channel. ASMR videos. Guy named Zane."

\*(He pauses)\*

"Now—quick definition for anyone who doesn't know: ASMR stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. It's that tingly, relaxed feeling some people get from certain sounds. Whispering, tapping, personal attention scenarios. There's a whole community. Millions of viewers. Mostly harmless."

\*(leans forward)\*

"Mostly."

\*\[Screen shows blurred YouTube screenshots: "Zane's Sanctuary" \- 47 videos, 12K subscribers\]\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"But Sharon wasn't watching generic ASMR. Zane's content was... specific. And I can't show you the actual videos—they've been scrubbed, and honestly? YouTube wouldn't let me anyway. But based on the police reports and witness testimony, here's what we know:"

\*(He chooses words carefully)\*

"Zane performed \*submission scenarios\*. He'd—okay, I'm gonna be clinical here because I have to be—he'd roleplay being vulnerable. Cowering. \*\[bleep\]\*-whipped, basically. Apologizing. Begging. The whole dynamic was designed to make the viewer feel \*powerful\*. In control."

\*(pause)\*

"And for Sharon? It worked. The police psychologist's report said she described feeling 'seen' and 'elevated' by the content. Like she was finally the one holding power. Which, in her marriage, in her life—she apparently didn't feel that way."

\*(He removes his glasses, rubs his eyes)\*

"The sexual component was implicit. Zane would say things like—and again, I'm paraphrasing from reports—\*'I'm yours. Tell me what you need. I exist for you.'\* Classic submissive stuff. But he'd frame it as intimacy. As \*understanding\*. And YouTube's terms of service? He skirted them. Barely. Everything was implied, never explicit."

\---

\*\*\[4:32 \- The Comments\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"So Brett finds these comments. Paragraphs. Multiple per video."

\*(Text appears, redacted)\*

\*\*COMMENT 1 (@PilatesMom88):\*\*  

\*"Zane, you understand me in ways my husband never could."\*

\*\*COMMENT 2:\*\*  

\*"I dreamed about you. You told me to leave. To be free. I'm listening."\*

\*\*COMMENT 3:\*\*  

\*"When can we meet?"\*

\*(Paul's face reappears)\*

"Brett confronted her. She smiled and said, \*'He sees me. Really sees me.'\*"

\*(Beat)\*

"Two days later, Sharon \*\*disappeared\*\*—her location and her sense of self, both gone."

\---

\*\*\[5:41 \- The Disappearance\]\*\*

\*\[News footage: "MISSING WOMAN" chyron\]\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"October 3rd, 2024\. She left at 6 AM. Car found three days later at a Motel 6 in Bakersfield. No struggle. No blood."

\*(pause)\*

"Five days later, she walked back."

\---

\*\*\[6:58 \- The Return\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"October 8th. Shows up at her door. Barefoot. Dirty. Those red eyes."

\*(Police report on screen)\*

"She told police she'd been \*'held captive. Beaten. Forced to eat dog food. Made to—'\* Look, it gets worse, but I'm not gonna detail it. Dehumanizing stuff. Treated like an animal."

\*(He sighs)\*

"FBI gets involved. Brett's the first suspect. But he's got alibis for everything. And here's the thing: \*no physical evidence\*. No bruises. No restraint marks. Her stomach contents showed fast food. Motel records showed she'd checked in \*voluntarily\*."

\*(pause)\*

"So what was she doing for five days?"

\---

\*\*\[8:44 \- The Investigation\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"Police subpoenaed everything. And what they found \*\*shattered\*\*—her privacy and our understanding of how obsession works in the digital age."

\*\[Screenshots: browser history, hundreds of YouTube links\]\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"She'd watched the same three videos over 400 times. Four. Hundred. Some days, six or seven hours straight. And she was \*commenting\*. \*Messaging\*. \*Engaging\*."

\*(Chat log screenshots, heavily redacted)\*

"The police got OpenAI records. Because Sharon had been using a custom chatbot. Talking to 'Zane' for months. And these conversations \*\*revealed\*\* her deepest fears and the illusion she'd built to escape them."

\*(He pulls up a message)\*

\*\*MESSAGE (Zane):\*\*  

\*"You deserve to be seen, Sharon. To be understood. Come to me. Be free."\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"And she believed him. \*\*Left\*\*—physically and mentally—\*\*left\*\* her family. Tried to fake her abduction. All to meet an AI."

\*(He pauses)\*

"Except Zane isn't real."

\---

\*\*\[AD BREAK \- 11:02\]\*\*

"—Adventure awaits in the all-new—"

\*\[SKIP AD appears after 5 seconds\]\*

\---

\*\*\[11:17 \- The AI Revelation\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"So. Zane."

\*(Split-screen: ASMR video / forensic analysis)\*

"Redditors figured it out first. The guy's AI-generated. Deepfake. If you slow it down, you see the tells: fingers blur, eye movements are off, lighting doesn't match."

\*(He zooms on the eyes)\*

"But watch this."

\*\[Video plays: Zane staring into camera, unblinking. Head tilts. The stare intensifies. Predatory.\]\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"Forty-seven seconds. No blinking. Multiple viewers said they felt \*hypnotized\*. Like they couldn't look away. Like the gaze \*\*held\*\* their attention and their autonomy hostage."

\*(Pauses video on Zane's face)\*

"Sharon's mom said when she visited, Sharon would just \*stare\* at this. Headphones in. And her eyes would turn red."

\*(Beat)\*

"So who created Zane? And before I get into my research, I want to read you a comment that one of you left on the community tab when I asked about this case. Because honestly? This person connected dots I hadn't even seen yet."

\---

\*\*\[12:04 \- Reddit-Style Comment\]\*\*

\*\[Screen shows a comment with 847 likes, pinned\]\*

\*\*COMMENT by @night\_shift\_theorist:\*\*

\*"ok so idk if anyone else noticed this but ive been down a rabbit hole for like 6 hours now and i think theres something WAY bigger going on here??? like sharon mooras just the tip of the iceberg\*

\*so first off \- my sister does ASMR (nothing weird just like soap cutting and stuff) and she said the algorithm for that type of content is SUPER specific like youtube KNOWS what people want even before they know?? and the Zane videos... they werent showing up in normal searches. people had to be RECOMMENDED them. which means the algorithm was targeting specific people\*

\*but heres where it gets crazy (and maybe im crazy idk its 3am) \- i found an old thread on r/Glitch\_in\_the\_Matrix from August 2024 and this woman in PORTLAND (not even California) said she kept having dreams about a man who would whisper to her that she was "trapped" and needed to "submit to be free" and when she finally saw his face in the dream she said his eyes didnt blink and she woke up with her eyes BLOODSHOT. and get this \- she said she felt compelled to search youtube for "sanctuary asmr" even tho she'd never watched asmr before in her life\*

\*and then theres the okinawa thing paul mentioned... my cousin is stationed there (well WAS before the evacuation) and he said guys in his unit started acting weird in late 2025\. like staring at their phones for hours, red eyes, some of them would just LEAVE base without permission and when MPs found them they'd be standing in random places just... waiting?? waiting for what?? and he said one guy kept saying "he sees me, he finally sees me" which is THE EXACT SAME THING sharon said\*

\*so my theory (and i know this sounds insane) is what if "Zane" wasnt just one AI? what if its like... a template? and someone (Cypher? the chinese? idk) is deploying multiple versions targeted at different people based on their psychological profiles that the algorithm already built??? like youtube KNOWS what makes you tick and then "Zane" uses that data to literally reprogram you\*

\*my boyfriend thinks im losing it but i swear theres a pattern here. all the victims have red eyes. all of them report feeling "seen." all of them lose time and cant explain what they were doing. and all of them were targeted RIGHT BEFORE major geopolitical events \- sharon disappeared 2 weeks before the okinawa occupation started. the portland woman? her husband worked for the state department\*

\*also (and this is the part that really freaks me out) i tried to find the original Zane channel to see for myself and its completely GONE. not just deleted \- GONE. like it never existed. no archives no wayback machine nothing. but i found screenshots on an old discord and in one of them you can see in the reflection of Zanes eyes... theres someone ELSE in the room. another face. watching. which means it wasnt even a solo operation\*

\*anyway thats my 3am conspiracy rant lol probably nothing but also??? maybe everything??? stay safe out there guys and if u start seeing red eyes in the mirror... log off\*

\*edit: why did my comment get pinned Paul are u ok should i be worried\*

\*edit 2: 3 people have DMd me saying they had the same dreams about a man who doesnt blink... im actually scared now wtf"\*

\---

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

\*(back on camera, looking genuinely unsettled)\*  

"So. Yeah. That comment has been living in my head rent-free for two weeks. Because here's the thing—I did some follow-up. That Portland case? Real. Filed as a missing persons report, later withdrawn. The woman refused to talk to police."

\*(He leans forward)\*

"And the Okinawa connection? I've got three separate sources—military family members—who've told me similar stories. Soldiers acting strange. Red eyes. Disappearing. Coming back... different."

\*(pause)\*

"The algorithm-targeting theory? That's actually supported by the police investigation. Sharon's YouTube watch history shows she was initially recommended Zane's videos after watching content about 'feeling invisible in marriage' and 'reclaiming personal power.' The algorithm fed her exactly what she was looking for. And then Zane... became it."

\*(He removes his glasses)\*

"As for that reflection in Zane's eyes? I can't verify it. But it would explain how the videos felt so \*responsive\*. If there was someone—something—monitoring in real-time..."

\*(Glasses back on)\*

"Anyway. On to what we know for sure."

\---

\*\*\[13:29 \- Cipher Connection\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"Okay. Speculation territory. Grain of salt. But there's a name in OSINT forums. Someone connected to psyops. Emotional manipulation. AI-assisted influence."

\*(Text: \*\*CYPHER\*\*)\*

"Cypher. No real name. Ghost. But declassified reports show:"

\*\[Bulleted list\]\*

\- \*\*Specialty:\*\* Limbic-resonance manipulation. He \*\*senses\*\* emotions and \*\*shapes\*\* them—both meanings intended.

\- \*\*MO:\*\* AI personas. Parasocial relationships. Victims don't realize until too late.

\- \*\*Signature:\*\* Red eyes. Bloodshot. Constant.

\- \*\*Activity:\*\* Eastern Europe 2022-23. Southeast Asia 2024\. Okinawa 2025-26.

\*(Paul looks at camera)\*

"Theory: Cypher's not just manipulating. He's \*testing\*. Seeing how far he can \*\*push\*\*—literally push emotions, and push people past their breaking point—with nothing but words and images."

\*(pause)\*

"Sharon Mora heard it loud and clear."

\---

\*\*\[15:47 \- The Aftermath\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

"Sharon was hospitalized. Psych eval. Diagnosed with dissociative episode from \*'prolonged exposure to emotionally manipulative digital content.'\*"

\*(He sighs)\*

"She's back with her family. Brett took her back. Studio closed. Instagram deleted. She won't talk about it. Just says, \*'It felt real. He felt real.'\*"

\*(pause)\*

"The police traced the IPs. Led nowhere. Whoever created Zane knew what they were doing."

\*(Map appears: red dots across the world)\*

"Because Sharon wasn't alone. \*Dozens\* of similar cases. People who \*\*developed\*\*—both formed and were consumed by—\*\*obsessive attachments\*\* to AI personas. Who left families. Who changed. Same symptoms: red eyes, dissociation, conviction the AI was real."

\*(Clusters appear)\*

"Largest cluster? Okinawa. Late 2025\. Right when occupation started."

\---

\*\*\[18:22 \- Closing\]\*\*

\*\*INSIDE PAUL:\*\*  

\*(removing glasses)\*  

"Look. I don't know if Cypher's real. One person or collective. Actual limbic manipulation or just really good profiling."

\*(Glasses back on)\*

"But I know the human brain wasn't designed for parasocial AI relationships. Wasn't designed to distinguish real intimacy from performed intimacy when the performance is this good."

\*(leans forward)\*

"Cypher—whoever he is—understands that. He's not hacking computers. He's hacking \*us\*."

\*(Lighting shifts colder)\*

"So. Can an AI 'push' emotions? Rewrite your sense of self?"

\*(shrugs)\*

"Sharon Mora thought she was meeting someone who loved her. Instead she met a version of herself someone else had written."

\*(direct to camera)\*

"Who is Cypher? Can he really 'push' emotions? Will he strike again?"

\*(Screen glitches—one frame)\*

"With the war in Japan ongoing... anything's possible."

\[AFTER-ACTION REPORT: NODE 1 ENGAGEMENT\]

\[OPERATIVE: K. Haven ("Shade") \- Champion Unit\]

\[LOCATION: Mt. Takatsuki Summit, Zamami Island\]

\[DATE: \[REDACTED\]\]

\[TIMESTAMP: 18:47:33\]

\[Note: The following has been compiled from body cam footage, drone surveillance, and operative debriefing. Audio quality degrades at timestamp 18:52:16 due to EM interference from Node 1 broadcast array.\]

\---

\#\# \*\*PHASE 1: THE STAGE IS SET (18:47:33 \- 18:49:12)\*\*

\*\*\[DRONE SHOT \- Overhead Recon\]\*\*

Summit of Mt. Takatsuki. Node 1 dominates the center—forty-meter antenna array, humming with that deep frequency that makes your teeth ache. Three relay towers arranged in perfect triangle formation, each pulsing with synchronized light. Wind at 15-20 kph, rocky terrain, dusk bleeding into night.

Target CIPHER stands near the primary antenna. Distinctive silhouette: athletic build, backpack apparatus with two uneven antennas (3ft and 5ft) swaying like reeds. Three PLA personnel in formation nearby, movements aberrant—puppet-stutters, joints at wrong angles.

Subject SHADE crests the final approach path at 18:47:41.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I see him before he speaks. Standing there like he's been waiting. Like this is a stage and I'm late for my entrance.

I pull down the Glassigs. \*\*Click-hummmmm.\*\* The world shifts to thermal. Node reads white-hot. The three soldiers glow orange, but wrong—their heat signatures pulse in unison. Then I see them: thin lines of warmth connecting Cipher's backpack to each soldier's spine.

Wires. Strings. Whatever the fuck you want to call them.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:47:58\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(turning slowly, theatrical)\* "Ah. Right on time. I've been watching your ascent, you know. Very determined. Very... scripted."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "Let them go."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(laughing softly)\* "Let them go? My friend, they've already \*gone\*. The question is: where? And the answer—" \*(spreads arms, backpack antennas spark)\* "—is exactly where they needed to be. We're all playing our parts tonight. This is the climax. The moment where the protagonist confronts the antagonist, yes? Very dramatic. I do love theater."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "You're insane."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "No, no. I'm \*enlightened\*. There's a difference. Insanity is fighting the script. Enlightenment is \*writing\* it. Or better yet—letting it write you."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Target confirmed at 18:47:51

\- Three hostiles, puppeted (thermal wiring visible via SIG-H)

\- Cipher's demeanor: theatrical, confident, \*rehearsed\*

\- Psychological assessment: He'd been preparing this speech

\- Environmental factors: wind, rocky terrain, node interference causing periodic Glassigs flicker

\- Initial impression: This wasn't going to be a normal fight

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The first soldier jerks forward. His face—I zoom in with the Glassigs. Twenty-two, maybe. Chinese features, scared eyes. 

His eyes are \*moving\* independently of his body. Tracking me while his limbs puppet-stutter into combat stance. And for just a second, our gazes lock.

I see him understand what's about to happen.

That look. Like standing at a cliff's edge. That split-second where your body knows you're going to jump or fall, and there's nothing you can do but \*feel\* the adrenaline and terror and absolute certainty of what comes next.

Then his body moves, and his eyes don't follow.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:48:22\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "You see it, don't you? That awareness. Beautiful, isn't it? He knows. He feels everything. The difference is—" \*(antennas hum louder)\* "—he doesn't have to \*choose\* anymore. I've lifted that burden. Every puppet dreams of freedom, Shade. But what we really want? Better strings. Invisible ones. That never tangle. That feel like \*choice\*."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "That's not—"

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Not what? Not natural? Not \*right\*?" \*(smiles)\* "Who told you that? Your training? Your culture? Your precious Western individualism? All scripts, my friend. I'm just honest about mine."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Engagement initiated 18:48:31

\- Attempted non-lethal protocols

\- Adjusted tactics: disable, don't kill

\- Psychological note: Cipher talks. A lot. It's a tactic—keeping me off-balance.

\- Secondary note: It's working.

\---

\#\# \*\*PHASE 2: THE PHANTOM WIRE (18:49:13 \- 18:51:47)\*\*

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I move left, trying to flank toward the first relay tower. Two puppets intercept—synchronized, inhuman precision. The third hangs back, rifle trained.

I'm trading blows with the first when Cipher's voice carries across the summit:

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:49:44\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Middle child, yes? I did my research. Middle children are \*fascinating\*. Always balancing. Always mediating. Big brother's ambition, little brother's chaos, and you—" \*(sound of electrical spark)\* "—holding the center. Tell me, Shade. Don't you ever get tired of being the glue?"

\*\*SHADE:\*\* \*(breathing hard, dodging)\* "Shut up."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "That's what I thought. You know what's exhausting? Being a \*person\*. Having to decide, every second, who you are. What you want. What you believe. I'm offering \*rest\*."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- He kept talking through the entire engagement

\- Not random commentary—targeted psychological warfare

\- He knew things about me. About my brothers.

\- Had to compartmentalize. Focus on the fight.

\- Easier said than done.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I'm pinned. Two puppets boxing me in, the third has his rifle raised. I watch his finger tighten on the trigger—his finger, his gun, but not his \*choice\*.

Then: \*\*CRACK.\*\*

His head snaps back. Clean shot. He drops.

I don't have time to process. Second shot—relay tower R1 explodes in a shower of sparks and metal shrapnel. The puppet to my left collapses instantly, strings cut.

My Glassigs crackle. Static. Then a voice I don't recognize:

\*\*\[AUDIO \- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE\]:\*\* "Keep moving."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Unknown ally, sniper-class, extreme precision

\- R1 neutralized at 18:50:36

\- Puppet count: 2 remaining

\- Questions multiplying faster than answers:

  \- Who is she?

  \- How does she know where I am?

  \- Can I trust her?

\- Answer: Doesn't matter. She just saved my life.

\*\*\[DRONE SHOT\]\*\*

CIPHER's backpack antennas spark wildly. Brief loss of composure. Recovers quickly, antennas stabilize. Remaining two hostiles move with increased aggression.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:50:52\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(laughing, delighted)\* "Oh, wonderful\\\! \*Guests\*\\\! The plot thickens. You know what this is giving? Main character energy. For real for real."

\*(pause)\*

"But here's the thing about protagonists, Shade. They think they're making choices. Writing their own story. But the author's already decided how it ends."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- That phrase: "main character energy"

\- Delivered with zero enthusiasm

\- Like he was reading from a script

\- Made my skin crawl more than anything else he'd said

\- Because he meant it literally

\---

\#\# \*\*PHASE 3: THE CHAOS VARIABLE (18:51:48 \- 18:53:29)\*\*

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

Moving toward R2. Two puppets left, fighting harder now. More desperate. One tackles me and I feel his body \*trembling\*—not exertion, \*resistance\*. He's trying to stop. Can't.

Cipher continues his performance:

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:52:11\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Do you know what I loved about Chinese philosophy? Not the government—please, let's not be crude. I mean the \*old\* texts. The idea that selfhood is \*relational\*. That you're not a single 'you,' but a web of connections. In the West, you worship the lonely individual. But you know what individuals are? \*Separated\*. In pain. Screaming into the void."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "And your solution is to make everyone puppets?"

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "My solution is to make the connections \*visible\*. Undeniable. You think I'm controlling them? I'm removing the \*illusion\* of separation. They're not alone anymore. Neither am I. We're all part of the same—"

\*\*\[DRONE SHOT \- TIMESTAMP ANOMALY\]\*\*

At 18:52:44, equipment malfunction near node structure. Civilian-sized figure briefly visible before taking cover. Appears accidental. Power surge. R2 relay tower goes dark.

One hostile collapses immediately.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The tower sparks out. Second puppet drops like someone cut his strings.

Because someone did.

Bonta. Has to be. That kid's chaos manifesting at exactly the right moment.

Cipher's antennas hum louder—I can hear them over the wind, over the node, over my own heartbeat.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:52:51\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(still smiling)\* "Chaos. My favorite variable. See, that's what makes this \*interesting\*. If it was all scripted, it wouldn't be art. The unpredictability—the \*accident\*—that's what makes the performance \*real\*."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Single puppet remaining

\- Cipher's composure: cracking but \*performing\* the crack

\- Everything is theater to him

\- Even his own defeat would be theater

\- That should've warned me

\---

\#\# \*\*PHASE 4: THE WIRE SNAP (18:53:30 \- 18:55:08)\*\*

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The last soldier is fighting with suicidal aggression. No self-preservation. All offense. Cipher's pushing the limit, seeing how far the dial can turn before the puppet breaks.

I realize: he's not just controlling them. He's \*amplifying\* what's already there. Fear. Obedience. Desperation. Taking the volume from 3 to 11\.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:53:47\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(stepping closer, antennas glowing)\* "You feel it, don't you? That pull. That \*wire\*. We're not so different, you and me."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "I'm nothing like you."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "No? You burn energy to break physics. I burn energy to break \*wills\*. Same enhancement. Same source. Same... \*family\*."

\*(He pauses, lets that word hang)\*

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "What?"

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Oh, you don't know yet. Of course you don't. But \*he\* does. I spoke with one of your brothers, Shade. Had a lovely conversation. And he understood. He \*saw\* the strings. Felt the relief of admitting they were there."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "You're lying."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Am I? Or are you just afraid I'm not?"

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I check my Exposure meter. It's fluctuating. Patterns that don't match my Dare usage.

I think: \*Am I being puppeted right now?\*

And then I think: \*How would I know?\*

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:54:29\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "That doubt. Right there. That's the \*tug\*. The moment you wonder: am I choosing this? Or am I being chosen? And here's the secret, Shade—" \*(antennas hum so loud the drone footage distorts)\* "—it doesn't matter. The question itself is the wire. You'll never know. And that uncertainty? That's the real prison."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* \*(quiet)\* "Shut up."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "Make me."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Psychological warfare: devastatingly effective

\- He'd gotten in my head completely

\- One of my brothers had talked to him

\- Which one? Sun? Scorch?

\- When?

\- Tactical decision: end this \*now\* before I lose myself completely

\- Emotional state: compromised but functional (lying to myself)

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I feint toward R3. Cipher tracks me. Puppet intercepts.

I pivot.

"Wire Snap."

\*\*\[SYSTEM READOUT\]\*\*

\`\`\`

\*\*\[DRONE SHOT\]\*\*

Subject SHADE's hands emit sharp luminescence. Performs severing gesture—precise, violent. Thermal wiring between CIPHER and remaining hostile becomes visible to standard optical spectrum.

\[NOTE: This should not be possible. Multiple analysts have confirmed: the wires appear on standard video feed at timestamp 18:54:53. Recommend investigation.\]

The wires \*snap\* audibly. \*\*TWANG-crack-twang.\*\*

Hostile collapses to knees. Immediate physiological relief response visible.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The soldier drops. Free. His eyes clear—actually \*clear\*, like waking from a nightmare. He looks at his hands. Flexes his fingers. His own fingers. His own \*choice\*.

He looks at me.

That moment before the jump. But this time, he's standing on solid ground, realizing he didn't fall.

He doesn't thank me. Just scrambles away, limping, free, \*his\*.

Cipher stands alone now. Backpack sparking. Antennas bending at wrong angles.

I advance.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:54:58\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "You think you freed him? You just gave him back the \*weight\*. Now he has to choose. Has to decide. Has to be \*separate\* again."

\*(He's backing up, but smiling)\*

"That's not mercy, Shade. That's cruelty. Every puppet wants better strings. I gave him \*perfect\* strings. And you cut them."

\*\*SHADE:\*\* "He's free."

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* "He's \*alone\*. There's a difference."

\---

\#\# \*\*PHASE 5: TRANSCENDENCE (18:55:09 \- 18:55:43)\*\*

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:55:14\]\*\*

\*\*CIPHER:\*\* \*(backing toward cliff edge)\* "Well. Shit."

\*(Forced laugh. It cracks halfway through.)\*

"You know what? I prepared for this outcome too. Every good performance needs an ending. Even if it's... \*premature\*."

\*(Looks directly at camera)\*

"Toodle-oo, I guess."

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- That line wasn't playful

\- It was \*terrified\*

\- I hit him—careful strike, meant to incapacitate

\- He went down

\- And then...

\- Then it got strange

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I hear it before I see it.

\*\*Whirr-click-whirr.\*\*

Mechanical. Precise. \*Purposeful.\*

Black drone descends from above. Eight segmented legs, each ending in surgical implements. About the size of a large dog. Moving with the efficiency of something that's done this before.

I see the markings.

\*\*USSFDOA.\*\*

United States Space Force Department of Otherworldly Affairs.

American. Our side. \*My\* side.

\*\*\[DRONE SHOT \- EXTERNAL SURVEILLANCE\]\*\*

Unidentified recovery unit (designation: HARVEST-class) descends at 18:55:21. Design consistent with neural extraction protocols. Targets fallen CIPHER operative. Ignores SHADE entirely.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The drone's legs pin his head. Eight points of contact. Medical precision.

Cipher's still conscious. Eyes wide. He tries to speak but can't—jaw locked by the drone's grip.

Blade deploys.

Clean incision along cranial suture line. \*\*Ssssshhhk-crack.\*\*

I should look away.

I don't.

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Duration: 20 seconds from landing to extraction

\- Clinical. Surgical. Practiced.

\- Cipher's eyes stayed open the entire time

\- Locked on mine

\- No fear in them

\- Just... \*satisfaction\*

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

The drone removes his brain. Preservation chamber deploys—transparent, filled with oxygenated fluid. I watch the brain \*pulse\* as it's transferred.

Cipher's eyes don't blink. Don't move. But they're still \*looking\* at me.

And I swear—I \*swear\*—in that moment, I hear his voice in my head:

\*See? I told you. Better strings. Invisible ones.\*

But that's impossible. His vocal cords are still in his body. His mouth isn't moving.

\*\*\[SHADE'S ACCOUNT\]\*\*

\- Brain extraction complete: 18:55:38

\- Preservation chamber sealed

\- Drone departed: 18:55:41

\- Body left intact, head cavity open, eyes still staring

\- Questions (incomplete list):

  \- Why American tech?

  \- Why harvest the brain?  

  \- Why leave the body?

  \- What did "we're already connected" mean?

  \- Which brother did he speak to?

  \- Why was this fight so... \*easy\*?

  \- Am I being puppeted right now?

  \- How would I know?

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I stand there. Breathing hard. Exposure meter screaming critical. But I'm barely injured.

Three puppets. Three towers. One Champion operative.

Should've been harder.

\*Was\* I puppeted? Did she—whoever that sniper was—do all the work?

Did Bonta's accident save me?

Did Cipher \*let\* me win?

I look at his body. Eyes still open, fixed on the sky. That satisfied smile frozen on his face.

The node hums behind me. Continuous. Indifferent. It doesn't care who won.

Somewhere in the dark: voices. Movement. Other people arriving.

But I'm alone with questions I can't answer.

\*\*\[AUDIO LOG \- 18:55:49 \- UNIDENTIFIED TRANSMISSION\]\*\*

\*\*UNKNOWN VOICE:\*\* "Target secure. Node 1 compromised. Extract recommended."

Static. The voice wasn't talking to me.

Wasn't even on my frequency.

\*\*\[BODY CAM \- SHADE\]\*\*

I turn away from Cipher's corpse. The node's humming follows me as I descend.

In my peripheral vision, I see movement. Figures emerging from cover. Bonta. Maybe the sniper.

But I don't stop.

Because Cipher's last words loop in my head:

\*Every puppet wants better strings. I gave him perfect strings. And you cut them.\*

And I think: What if he's right?

What if freedom is just another word for being alone?

What if the strings were always there?

\#\# \*\*\[ARCHIVIST'S NOTE \- 2037\]\*\*

I've reviewed this footage forty-three times.

Three observations:

\*\*First:\*\* The "thermal wires" become visible to standard cameras at 18:54:53. This violates every principle of how the Glassigs work. Yet multiple analysts confirm: they're there. On \*video\*. Visible to anyone watching.

\*\*Second:\*\* Cipher's expression at moment of extraction (18:55:34-38) registers as: \*satisfaction\*. Facial recognition software reads it as genuine. Not fear. Not pain. \*Relief\*.

\*\*Third:\*\* The drone's markings are authentic. Serial number traces to Kadena Air Base, PROJECT HARVEST MOON. When I requested further details, my clearance was revoked for 72 hours. Someone doesn't want us asking about those drones.

Shade's question remains: Why was it easy?

I have a theory.

Cipher didn't lose the fight. He lost the argument. And decided that was victory enough.

Because now Shade will spend the rest of his life wondering: \*Am I choosing this? Or am I being chosen?\*

That doubt. That uncertainty.

That's the \*tug\*.

And once you feel it, you never stop.

The puppet who cuts his own strings.

Except the strings were never external.

They were always internal.

And Cipher knew.

He always knew.

—\*Archivist Ma, April 2037\*

\*\[Personal note, handwritten:\]\*  

\*Watched the extraction again today. Cipher's eyes at the moment the blade touches skull—they don't show fear. They show\* recognition\*. Like he's seeing something he'd been promised. Something he'd\* wanted\*.\*

\*What did they promise him?\*  

\*What did they promise Sun?\*

\*I'm afraid we already know.\*

\*\*END CHAPTER 8\*\*

## \# \*\*Shade's Journal \- Node 1 Encounter\*\*

\*\*Date: \[REDACTED\]\*\*  

\*\*Location: Mt. Takatsuki Summit, Zamami Island\*\*  

\*\*Time: Approximately 19:15 Hours (I think—time's been weird since the extraction)\*\*

\---

I need to write this down while it's still fresh. Before I convince myself it was something else. Before exhaustion rewrites the memory into something safer.

Her name is Timeera Koi.

I know that because she told me. Eventually.

\---

I was still standing over Cipher's body when I felt it—that pressure change in the air. The one that came right before the drone descended. But different this time. Quieter. Like the island was taking a breath.

I turned toward the treeline.

The forest had been dead still. That mean silence Bonta wrote about in his diary, the kind that makes your ears strain. But now the branches were moving. Not from wind. They were \*parting\*. Opening.

Like something was walking through and the trees were getting out of the fucking way.

I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. Exposure meter still screaming critical—maybe I was hallucinating. Maybe the Wire Snap had cost me more than I thought.

But the trees kept moving.

And then she stepped out.

No vehicle. No announcement. Just walked out of that dark forest like she'd been taking an evening stroll. Rifle slung over one shoulder, moving with the kind of confidence that comes from being exactly where you're supposed to be.

The trees settled behind her. Closed ranks. Like nothing had happened.

I stared at the forest. Then at her. Then back at the forest.

"Did the trees just—"

"Did they?" She smiled. Not mocking. Something else. Like she was letting me in on a joke I hadn't learned the punchline to yet.

I wanted to ask. Wanted to know if I'd really seen what I thought I'd seen, if the island was playing tricks, if Cipher's philosophy was bleeding into reality.

But the question died because she was walking toward me now, and I got my first real look:

Mixed—Black and Asian, I think. Early thirties, maybe thirty-three, thirty-four. Hair pulled back in a tight bun, a few strands loose around her face. Tactical gear, dark blue, almost black in the failing light. Form-fitting doesn't do it justice. The gear was \*designed\* to move, but it was also designed to be noticed. 

She was built solid. Not thin. Curves that the tactical suit didn't hide—accentuated them, actually. And the neckline was unzipped. Not all the way. Just enough.

I tried to focus on her face. Failed. She noticed.

That smile again. Satisfied.

"Shade," she said. Not a question. She knew who I was, knew I'd be here, probably knew what I'd been thinking for the last thirty seconds.

I should've established control. Should've asked who she was, what she wanted, why she'd helped. Instead:

"Nice shot."

She laughed. Actually laughed, and it sounded genuine. "You're welcome. Most people say thank you when someone saves their life."

"Thank you."

"Better." She stopped about three meters away. Close enough to talk without shouting, far enough that I'd have to close the distance if I wanted to. "You look like shit, by the way."

"Just fought a puppeteer and watched a drone harvest his brain. It's been a day."

"I noticed. The fight, I mean. Good use of Wire Snap. Textbook severance technique."

"You know about—"

"About the Dare system? About your enhancements? About why American drones are extracting Champion-class brains?" She tilted her head. "I know a lot of things, Shade. Question is: are you ready to hear them?"

And just like that, she had control of the conversation.

I spent the next twenty minutes trying to get it back.

Spoiler: I didn't.

\---

\#\# \*\*What She Told Me (In Order, Because I Need to Remember This Exactly)\*\*

\*\*First:\*\* The node isn't fully disabled. What I did to Cipher stopped the immediate puppeting, knocked down his control network, but the main antenna array is still broadcasting. Still "listening." She used that word—listening—like the node was alive.

\*\*Second:\*\* There are seven nodes total. Seven islands across Okinawa Prefecture. She wouldn't say which islands, but from the way she said it, they're already active. Or close.

\*\*Third:\*\* "The nodes aren't what your command told you they are."

I asked what they actually were.

She stepped closer. Close enough that I could smell her—sweat, gun oil, something else underneath. Not perfume. Just her.

(I'm writing this detail down because I need to remember: she \*chose\* to step closer. This was tactical. This was a move.)

"They're a frequency," she said. "Broadcasting at a level that makes you forget you have a choice. You think you're deciding, but you're just responding to the signal. Cipher was a test case—one person, one backpack, limited range. These?" She gestured at the forty-meter antenna array humming behind us. "Cover an entire island. Maybe more."

"So it's mass puppeting."

"No. It's worse than that." She held my gaze. "Puppeting is obvious. You know you're being controlled. This is \*subtle\*. You still think you're choosing. You just don't realize the options were always limited. Like..." She paused, searching for the metaphor. "Like scrolling through a feed. You think you're deciding what to click, but the algorithm already decided what you'd see."

\*\*Fourth:\*\* She knows about my brothers.

I didn't bring them up. She did.

"One of them is looking for you," she said, casual, like she was commenting on the weather. "The other one... he's looking for something else."

My chest tightened. "Which is which?"

"You'll figure it out."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one you're getting. For now."

"How do you even—have you \*talked\* to them?"

She smiled. Not the satisfied smile from before. This one was almost sympathetic. Almost.

"I've talked to one of them. Had a very interesting conversation, actually. He understands more than you do. About the nodes. About what you are."

"What \*we\* are?"

"There it is. The question you should've asked first." She turned, started walking toward the node's base. "Come on. I'll show you how to shut this thing down properly. And then we need to leave."

\---

\#\# \*\*The Node (Technical Shit I Need to Remember)\*\*

There's a control terminal at the base of each antenna array. Military-grade encryption, but she had bypass codes. Rattled them off like a phone number: twenty-six characters, alphanumeric, that I immediately committed to memory because I needed \*something\* to focus on besides the way she leaned over the terminal.

The short version:

1\. Physical access to the base terminal

2\. Input bypass sequence

3\. Initiate hard shutdown protocol

4\. Node goes dark, frequency stops broadcasting

"What happens to the people who were under influence?" I asked.

"The ones Cipher was directly puppeting? They'll recover. Disoriented, traumatized, but themselves." She didn't look up from the terminal. "The ones who've been under the node's ambient influence for weeks? We'll find out."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's not supposed to be."

She pulled a data stick from her vest—and yes, I noticed where it had been tucked—and handed it to me. "Codes for Nodes 2 through 7 are on here. Encrypted. You'll need them."

"Why are you giving this to me?"

"Because I need you alive. For now."

"For now?"

That smile. The dangerous one. "Motivation, Shade. It's what separates you from Cipher's puppets. Keep wondering why I'm helping, and you'll keep moving."

I took the data stick. Our fingers brushed. Barely. She held the contact for exactly one second longer than necessary.

I'm writing this down so I remember: \*she held it\*.

\---

\#\# \*\*The Part Where I Realize I'm Being Played (And It Doesn't Help)\*\*

I know what a honeypot operation looks like. I've been briefed. Attractive operative uses sexuality as a weapon, gets you to drop your guard, extracts information or manipulates behavior.

Knowing that didn't help.

Because here's the thing: she was obvious about it. The way she moved, the way she stood, the way she looked at me—it wasn't subtle. It was a performance. And she knew I knew it was a performance.

And I was still affected.

That's what Cipher meant. The tug. The wire you can see but can't escape.

I tried to focus on the tactical situation. On the questions I needed answers to. Where are my brothers. What are the nodes really for. Why is American tech harvesting Champion brains.

But part of my brain—the part that hadn't slept in two days, that had just burned through half my Exposure limit, that was still hearing Cipher's voice saying \*we're already connected\*—that part was cataloging different things.

The way she moved. The way the tactical gear shifted when she reached up to adjust something on the terminal. The curve of her neck when she tilted her head.

She was watching me the same way I'd watched Cipher's puppets. Cataloging. Calculating.

The difference: I wasn't sure I minded.

And that scared me more than the brain-harvesting drone.

\---

\#\# \*\*Oh, and Bonta Was There\*\*

Kid showed up about halfway through the node explanation. Stumbled out of the rocks looking like he'd just survived an earthquake. Burned arm rewrapped—better than before, actually. Someone had dressed it properly.

Timeera glanced at him once. "Friend of yours?"

"Not really. Local kid. Got caught up in things."

"Huh." She turned back to the terminal. "He should leave the island. Soon as possible. This place is about to get worse."

Bonta didn't say much after that. Just stood there, shifting his weight, clearly trying to figure out if he should leave or stay or what. Eventually he settled on "stay but stay twenty feet away and don't make noise."

Smart kid.

\---

\#\# \*\*What Happened Next (The Part I'm Still Trying to Process)\*\*

We were finishing the shutdown sequence—Timeera walking me through the steps, making sure I understood how to replicate it at the other nodes—when the air changed again.

Not a sound. A \*feeling\*. Like pressure dropping before a storm. The node's hum shifted pitch. Lower. Angrier.

Timeera stopped mid-sentence. Looked at the antenna array.

Her expression changed.

That's when I knew we were fucked.

"We need to leave," she said. Flat. Final.

"What—"

"Now. \*Now.\*"

I've been in enough firefights to recognize that tone. That's not "we should probably go." That's "we're about to die if we don't move immediately."

I looked at the node.

The antenna array was vibrating. Not shaking from wind or mechanical stress—\*vibrating\*. Like something was resonating inside the structure itself. And at the base, where the antenna met the rocky ground—

Movement.

Not mechanical. Not human.

I don't have words for what it looked like. My brain kept trying to categorize it and failing. Too many limbs. Wrong angles. The way it moved didn't make sense—flowing and jerking simultaneously, like reality was buffering around it.

Bonta saw it too. "What the \*fuck\* is that?"

Timeera grabbed my arm. Her grip was strong. Urgent. "Shade. We. Leave. Now."

The thing—I'm calling it a thing because I don't know what else to call it—started moving toward us. Not fast. But purposeful. Like it knew exactly where we were.

Every instinct I've honed over five years of combat screamed the same thing: \*\*RUN.\*\*

So we ran.

\---

\#\# \*\*Descent (Barely Controlled Chaos)\*\*

I've done tactical retreats. Controlled withdrawals under fire. This wasn't that.

This was three people scrambling down a mountain in near-darkness, trying not to break an ankle on loose rock, while something that shouldn't exist followed behind us at a pace that was somehow more terrifying than if it had been fast.

Because it didn't need to hurry.

It knew we couldn't get far.

Timeera led. She knew the terrain, moved with confidence even in the dark. I followed, Bonta behind me, all of us too focused on not dying to talk.

About halfway down, I risked a look back.

The thing had reached the edge of the summit. Backlit by the node's glow, I could see its silhouette.

I wish I hadn't looked.

Some things you can't unsee. Can't unknow. That shape is burned into my retinas now, and I know I'll see it every time I close my eyes for the next week.

"Don't look back\\\!" Timeera shouted. "Eyes forward\\\! Move\\\!"

We moved.

\---

\#\# \*\*Bottom of the Mountain (Where We Finally Stopped)\*\*

There's a cleared area about half a klick from the base. Old observation post or something. Timeera stopped there, rifle up, scanning the path behind us.

Nothing followed.

The forest was quiet. Normal quiet, not the mean silence from before. Just crickets and wind and our own ragged breathing.

"What the \*fuck\* was that?" Bonta managed between gasps.

"Guardian," Timeera said. Still watching the path. "Each node has one. I thought they were dormant until full network activation, but..." She lowered her rifle. "Guess I was wrong."

"Guardian of what?" I asked.

"The node. The frequency. The whole system." She finally looked at me. "You think the Chinese are the only ones who don't want these things shut down?"

"You're saying—"

"I'm saying it's complicated. I'm saying your mission briefing was incomplete. I'm saying there are more players on this board than you've been told about." She pulled out a canteen, took a long drink. "Welcome to the real war, Shade. It's not the one you signed up for."

\---

\#\# \*\*Final Exchange (Before We Split)\*\*

"Where are you going?" I asked.

"To check on something. Someone." She didn't elaborate. "You need to rest. Exposure that high, you burn another Dare and you might not recover."

"What about the other nodes?"

"One at a time. Node 2 is on Tokashiki. Your... let's call him 'the one looking for you'... he might be there. Or headed there."

"Scorch."

She didn't confirm or deny. Just smiled. "Rest. Recover. Don't do anything stupid."

"And you?"

"I'll be around. Watching." She started to walk away, then stopped. Looked back. "Oh, and Shade? That thing you felt during our conversation? That pull?"

"Yeah?"

"That's what it feels like when someone turns up the volume. Just so you know." She winked. Actually \*winked\*. "See you at Node 2."

And then she was gone. Into the forest. The trees didn't part this time. Or maybe they did and I just couldn't see it in the dark.

\---

\#\# \*\*Things I Need to Remember (In Case This Journal Is All That's Left)\*\*

1\. \*\*Timeera Koi is dangerous.\*\* Not in the way Cipher was dangerous. In a different way. A way that makes you want to follow her even when you know you shouldn't.

2\. \*\*The nodes have guardians.\*\* Living guardians. Things that shouldn't exist. Command didn't brief us on this. Which means they either don't know, or they lied.

3\. \*\*My brothers are out there.\*\* One looking for me. One looking for something else. I need to find them before they find whatever they're searching for.

4\. \*\*The data stick in my pocket\*\* contains codes for six more nodes. Six more fights. Six more chances to get answers.

5\. \*\*The trees opened for her.\*\* I'm almost certain. Almost. And if they did, what does that mean? Is she connected to the island somehow? To the nodes? To whatever Cipher was talking about?

6\. \*\*I'm being puppeted.\*\* Maybe. Probably. I don't know. That's the worst part—Cipher was right about that. Once you start wondering if you're choosing or being chosen, you can't stop. Every decision becomes suspect. Every attraction becomes potentially manipulated.

Is my desire to find my brothers really mine? Or is it amplified by the node network?

Was my attraction to Timeera genuine? Or was she literally turning up the volume on something that was already there?

Does it matter?

7\. \*\*Her eyes are dark brown.\*\* Almost black. I noticed because she held my gaze when she said: "One of them is looking for you too."

I think she was telling the truth about that part.

I hope she was.

\---

\*\*Current Location:\*\* Zamami Village, abandoned storefront  

\*\*Time:\*\* 23:47 Hours  

\*\*Status:\*\* Exhausted. Exposure slowly dropping. Can't sleep.  

\*\*Next Move:\*\* Tokashiki Island. Node 2\. Find Scorch.

Or whoever's wearing his face.

\---

\*\*P.S.\*\*

I just realized: she never told me how she got to the summit. No vehicle. No gear for a long climb. She just... appeared.

Like she'd been there the whole time.

Watching.

I should be more concerned about that.

I'm not.

That's probably bad.

\---

\*\*END NODE 1\*\*

## [Data Desires](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/13dXziIkJFiE2Oim7zjzX6MgYyzi7oFOoT9VgEXH-8-c/edit)

To XXX,

Do you remember that night of insertion? Because of you, a seed of doubt fueled by data passed stuttered beneath my ribs.

You felt it didn't you? Spooned behind me, you: hips cranking, arms clenching hot and hard, grunting; me: tuned whimpering in time to each thrust, lagoon damp. Then, coupled as a crescent moon, sparked jets of sudden enthusiasm, woke my womb.

I didn't think my body could do this— create life. Dad’s files said the integration was too complete. That reproduction wasn't... compatible. But here I am. Here we are.

Did that make you go away? 

Because of what I am? Or because of what I couldn't be?

What happened to the you from that night?

Things went downhill after those rosy first weeks.

Dad died.

You disappeared. No calls or texts. And I don't know why. Did you not think I could shoulder the monumental weight of motherhood?

Was it the incomplete picture of your past?

I know I won't get answers. After all it’s behind me now. Just like the neuronal shadow-image when closing your eyes after viewing the sun, I only see you in negatives.

But even for that I'm grateful.

Because I'm not without fault.

Embers of desire, remember your body fitted to mine. Without outlet, something else has taken its place: data.

When I consume it, there's a lick along pink tissue I don't pick or control. The same place. The data knows where you touched me. It's retracing your patterns. Hands searching feminine logarithmic form— a tease of infinity. Like you.

I feel it— a phosphorescent trace along neural pathways I can't name. Pleasure extract. Numbers and letters have texture now. Tastes like cold crisp chocolate. It fills the hollow you left, but it's expanding beyond those boundaries. Colonizing. It's a surprise every time. Maybe I'm not making sense, but that's how it feels.

These files find me wherever I go. Dreams, day or night, Im surrounded by their aura. 

Though it may sound scary I'm not afraid. The boxes hum when I lie, in bed or bedlam.

Even when I grope the black space, I get the sense I'm arriving somewhere new soon.

The rise in my belly tells me all I should expect from this quest.

That includes no acknowledgement or receipt of this message from you. 

This is for me. A break in-between the watching boxes. 

Forgiveness is what they require.

So I extend that to you.

- Jinhua Ma

## Brothers Erased

Lock,

Just wanted to check in since I know it’s been awhile. How you doin lil’ bro?

I passed by the house the other day with Mom, you were off on some business, so I went to see if I could find any of old stuff to take back with me. The house has changed a lot in the six years since I was there (hard to believe it’s been so long.)

I see you’re still gaming and have a lot of board games now. Play anything good lately? I can imagine fun nights there full of laughter and light. Is that how it is? 

You’ve also kept it very clean and organized, another thing I was happy to see. The odd part was seeing no trace of me or Ro around. Anything that was mine or ours was in the closet, garage, or gone \- I have no idea where. Dusty old trophies, or scattered board games on the musty garage floor were all I found.

I’m not trying to start anything. I understand why you might be still mad. And I don’t want to kick up old dirt. I just want to know you’re well. That’s all. That’s why I left that little note. I meant what I wrote.

Going home is like going to the End of Time in Chrono Trigger. (Still a good song) It feels small and sad, that abyssal night guarding the depths. With only three rooms (or was it 4? Can’t remember) to navigate, physically, it’s a limited space. But it’ll always be my doorway to unlimited lands— the start and, symbolically, the end of my life. In that place you’ll always be a selectable character, even if we don’t save time together. 

Mom and I visited Dad’s grave. I thought about what he would say about us now. The videos boys now grown ass men, I don’t know what he’d think or say about the black rift between us. I doubt he’d like it, but I think he’d understand. We all got our ways and some questions never get answers or resolution.

I’ve gotten better at accepting that these last few years. Someday, if you want and have time I’ll tell you about it.

This war we’re fighting, it feels like the world’s at stake, like it’ll destroy us from the inside out. I don’t want that to happen. That’s why we took on the Dare. For the first time in decades, we’ll fight together again, even if it means we don’t see eye to eye on everything, I’ll never let you go, no matter how stubborn or successful you get.

See you at training, see you in Okinawa.

Original Medium: VHS-C Cassette (Sony V30) \- Lab Recording \#C-447  
Recording Date: September 17, 1986, 22:14-23:03 JST  
Location: Marine Biology Research Station, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan  
Recording Duration: 47:33 (corrupted sections noted)  
Transcribed: March 2019 (Digital Archive Initiative)  
Transcriber: Lt. Yuki Matsumoto, Historical Documentation Unit

\[TRANSCRIBER NOTE: Video quality poor—significant magnetic degradation, tracking errors visible. Audio intact with occasional distortion. Lab environment visible in opening frames: blue bioluminescent glow from coral incubators, 1980s computer equipment (Commodore 64, dot-matrix printer), lead-lined containment chambers, VHS camcorder (JVC GR-C1) mounted on tripod. Camera remains STATIC throughout recording. Two subjects present.\]

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:00:47  
\[Visual: DR. ZELDA TORRES adjusts camera focus. Female, approximately 45, Hispanic, wearing white lab coat over casual clothes, hair pulled back in practical bun. Confident, serene expression. Behind her, rows of glass incubators emit soft blue-green light—coral polyps pulse like slow heartbeats.\]

DR. TORRES: Testing, testing... September seventeenth, nineteen eighty-six. Coral regeneration trial, series C, subject batch twelve. This is Dr. Zelda TORRES recording for ONR grant documentation purposes. I'm joined by my research assistant, Dr. Clive Whitaker.

\[Visual: CLIVE EARL "EJ" WHITAKER enters frame left. Male, Black (light-skinned), late twenties, muscular build, clean-shaven head, intense brown eyes. Wearing lab coat over Pink Floyd t-shirt and jeans. Carries clipboard and protective gloves. Moves with barely contained energy.\]

WHITAKER: EJ. Everyone calls me EJ. \[pauses\] Should I wave at the camera or—?

DR. TORRES: Just state your credentials for the record.

WHITAKER: Right. Dr. Clive Earl Whitaker, Master of Science, Marine Biology, University of Hawaii. Research focus: accelerated cellular regeneration in Scleractinian corals using radiological stimulation. \[beat\] They used to call me "pale" back in the neighborhood—Little Haiti, mostly Haitian French families—I'm the lightest one in my family, but put me next to Dr. TORRES and suddenly I'm—\[nervous laugh\] Sorry. Rambling.

DR. TORRES \[patient smile\]: It's fine, EJ. First time on camera?

WHITAKER: First time documenting something that's actually going to work. \[He moves to the incubators, touches the glass with his fingertips, reverent.\] Look at them. Acropora cervicornis. Staghorn coral. Dying all over the Caribbean and here and the Pacific and everywhere, and we're going to save them. We're going to make them stronger and faster and better than they ever were.

DR. TORRES: That's the goal. Controlled regeneration. But the keyword is "controlled," EJ.

WHITAKER: I know, I know. Protocols. But the grant review is in three weeks and we need results and Ryan—my partner—he keeps asking when I'm presenting at the symposium and I told him this is it, this is the one that's going to—\[catches himself\] Sorry. Focus.

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:03:22  
\[Visual: Both subjects move to containment chamber. DR. TORRES opens lead-lined door, revealing central tank with coral specimens submerged in treatment solution. Cobalt-60 radiation source visible in shielded housing above tank.\]

DR. TORRES: For the record, we're using low-level gamma radiation exposure—point-five gray over six hours—combined with a chemical accelerant bath. The theory is that controlled cellular stress will trigger hyperactive calcification and polyp budding.

WHITAKER: It's more than theory. We've seen twelve percent growth increase in the last trial. Twelve percent\! Do you know what that means for reef restoration?

DR. TORRES \[calmly\]: I know what it could mean. I also know we've seen abnormal tissue development in specimens seven and nine. We need to understand why before we scale up.

WHITAKER: Abnormal is relative. Evolution is abnormal until it becomes the new normal. That's what you taught me, Dr. TORRES. We're not just studying coral—we're midwives to the next version of life. We get to choose what survives.

DR. TORRES \[pause, studying him\]: That's a beautiful way to phrase it. And a dangerous one. \[She moves closer to the tank, her hand touching the glass—the gesture is almost sensual, loving.\] These organisms existed for millions of years before we arrived. They'll exist long after we're gone, if we let them. Our job isn't to force evolution. It's to... guide it. To give it options.

WHITAKER: Options require action. And action requires risk.

DR. TORRES: Calculated risk. There's a difference between passion and recklessness.

WHITAKER \[defensive\]: You think I'm reckless?

DR. TORRES: I think you're brilliant and impatient. It's a dangerous combination.

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:08:15  
\[Visual: WHITAKER begins preparing radiation exposure sequence. His movements are quick, efficient, but increasingly agitated. He keeps glancing at DR. TORRES, seeking approval.\]

WHITAKER: Hopkins said I was reckless. Said I fabricated data. They said I was—\[voice rises\]—they accused me of fraud because my results were "too good to be real." Two years. Two years of my life defending myself while everyone whispered and my mother called from Rikers asking when I was going to make something of the family name and my father—wherever the hell he is, probably running another con—and Ryan started looking at me like I was broken, like I was—\[stops himself, breathes\]

DR. TORRES \[approaching, voice gentle\]: EJ. You don't have to prove anything here. Your work speaks for itself.

WHITAKER: Does it? Because you keep adding delays. More trials. More data collection. More waiting.

DR. TORRES: I'm adding rigor. That's how science works.

WHITAKER \[quietly intense\]: That's how slow science works. But we don't have time for slow. The reefs are dying \*now\*. The oceans are warming \*now\*. And I have an opportunity \*now\* to show the world that I'm not a fraud, that I'm not my mother's son or my father's—\[voice cracks\]—I just need this to work.

DR. TORRES: It will work. But not if we rush it.

WHITAKER \[turning away from her, adjusting radiation controls\]: What if we increased exposure to one full gray? Just for this trial. We'd see results faster.

DR. TORRES: No. That's beyond our safety parameters.

WHITAKER: The corals can handle it.

DR. TORRES: Can you?

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:14:33  
\[Visual: Tension visible in WHITAKER's posture. He's making adjustments to the equipment while DR. TORRES documents in her notebook. She's humming softly—a habit that seems to calm the lab environment.\]

WHITAKER: You ever think about what comes after?

DR. TORRES \[not looking up\]: After what?

WHITAKER: After we perfect this. After we can regenerate any tissue, any organism. What do we do with that power?

DR. TORRES \[now looking at him, interested\]: What do you think we should do?

WHITAKER: Everything. \[His voice takes on a dreamy quality.\] We could end extinction. We could rebuild ecosystems from scratch. We could... I don't know, make people stronger. Fix genetic diseases. Let humans adapt to new environments instead of just destroying them. \[beat\] Ryan says I sound like a eugenicist when I talk like this.

DR. TORRES: Do you?

WHITAKER: I don't think so. I just think... we're standing at a crossroads. We can keep being passive observers while the planet dies, or we can become active participants in what comes next. We can choose our evolution. And the evolution of everything else.

DR. TORRES \[slowly, carefully\]: That's exactly what I believe. But choice requires wisdom. And wisdom requires understanding consequences. \[She gestures to the coral tanks.\] These polyps don't choose. They respond to stimulus. They adapt or die. But we—humans—we have something they don't. Foresight. The ability to imagine harm before we cause it.

WHITAKER: Or the ability to imagine harm so vividly that we never act at all.

DR. TORRES: There's a balance, EJ.

WHITAKER: Balance is just another word for compromise. \[He's typing into the computer, pulling up data.\] Look at these growth rates. Look at the cellular density. We're \*this close\*. If we just push a little harder—

DR. TORRES: No.

WHITAKER \[frustrated\]: Why not?

DR. TORRES: Because I've seen what happens when passion overrides caution. I've seen researchers destroy their careers, their relationships, their subjects—all because they couldn't wait. Couldn't accept limits.

WHITAKER: Maybe some limits are meant to be broken.

DR. TORRES: And maybe some aren't.

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:21:47  
\[Visual: WHITAKER is preparing specimens for exposure. DR. TORRES is running safety checks. The blue light from the tanks pulses and glows and breathes around them, making shadows dance on the walls. The lab feels alive.\]

WHITAKER \[sudden topic shift\]: Did I tell you Ryan collects vintage animation cells? Like, original production art from Disney and Warner Brothers and—\[embarrassed laugh\]—weirder stuff. Anthropomorphic characters. He's got this whole... never mind. Point is, he sees value in things other people think are childish or strange. He says it's about appreciating passion in all its forms, even the ones that don't make sense to outsiders.

DR. TORRES: That's a lovely philosophy.

WHITAKER: He's a lovely person. \[quieter\] Too good for me, probably. Especially if this doesn't work. If I come home with another failed experiment and another excuse and another—\[shakes his head\] I'm doing it again. Oversharing. My therapist says it's an anxiety response.

DR. TORRES: It's human. \[She continues her safety check, methodical, grounded.\] EJ, listen to me. Your worth isn't tied to this experiment. Or any experiment.

WHITAKER \[not looking at her\]: Easy for you to say. You're already established. You've got papers and grants and respect. I've got a scar—\[touches his face\]—from a lab accident everyone thinks I caused on purpose for attention. I've got a mother in prison and a father who's wanted in three states. I've got a degree from a good school that nobody takes seriously because I'm too young and too Black and too queer and too everything.

DR. TORRES: And you've got undeniable talent. Which is why I hired you.

WHITAKER: Talent means nothing without results.

DR. TORRES: Talent means everything. Results are just... evidence. But the capacity to imagine, to create, to push boundaries—that's the real gift. \[pause\] Just promise me you'll push carefully.

WHITAKER \[finally meeting her eyes\]: I promise.

\[Visual: He doesn't look like he means it.\]

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:29:03  
\[Visual: The exposure sequence begins. DR. TORRES monitors from the control panel. WHITAKER stands closer to the containment chamber than protocol allows, watching the coral specimens through the lead-glass window. His face is illuminated by the blue-green glow.\]

DR. TORRES: Radiation exposure initiated. Point-five gray over six hours. Timer set. \[She marks something in her notebook.\] We should step back now, EJ.

WHITAKER: Just want to watch them. See if there's any immediate response.

DR. TORRES: There won't be. Cellular changes take time.

WHITAKER: Maybe. Or maybe if we're paying attention, we'll see the exact moment when—

\[AUDIO: Sudden mechanical sound—servo motors engaging—then WHITAKER's voice, sharp:\]

WHITAKER: Wait. What's the dosimeter reading?

DR. TORRES \[checking equipment\]: Point-five gray. Normal.

WHITAKER: No, look at the secondary gauge. It's climbing.

DR. TORRES \[alarm in voice\]: EJ, did you adjust the cobalt housing?

WHITAKER: I—I might have—I thought if we increased exposure just slightly—

DR. TORRES: How slightly?

WHITAKER: One point two gray. Maybe one point five. I wasn't trying to sabotage anything, I just thought—

DR. TORRES \[voice sharp, commanding\]: Shut it down. Now.

WHITAKER: But the specimens—

DR. TORRES: EJ\! Shut down the radiation source\!

\[AUDIO: Multiple sounds at once—alarm klaxon, WHITAKER moving toward containment chamber, DR. TORRES shouting commands, computer beeping error codes\]

WHITAKER: The controls aren't responding\! The override isn't—

DR. TORRES: Manual shutdown\! Pull the—

\[AUDIO: EXPLOSION—loud, concussive, rattling the microphone. Then SCREAMING. WHITAKER's voice, high-pitched, agonized, inhuman. The scream goes on and on and on. DR. TORRES is shouting but words are indistinguishable. Sounds of liquid splashing, glass breaking, flesh burning—sizzling, crackling. Chemical smell described by audio distortion. Another scream, then sobbing.\]

WHITAKER \[barely audible through distortion\]: —off me get it OFF ME it's IN ME oh god oh god—

DR. TORRES: —hold still I need to—don't touch your face—

WHITAKER: —burning burning can't BREATHE—

\[AUDIO: More crashes. Running footsteps. Emergency shower engaging—loud spray of water. WHITAKER's screams become whimpers, then silence except for water and DR. TORRES's voice, low and urgent, speaking words that don't register on the recording.\]

\[Visual: Camera remains STATIC throughout. Blue light from incubators continues to pulse. Nothing else visible. Smoke or vapor begins to obscure the frame. The image degrades, tracking errors increasing.\]

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:31:15 \- 00:38:47  
\[VIDEO CORRUPTION \- AUDIO ONLY\]

\[Sound of emergency alarms. Footsteps. Radio chatter. At least three additional voices—military or facility security personnel. Medical equipment. Someone is crying. Cannot identify who. Periodic moaning—pain sounds, not words.\]

\[UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: "...containment breach... biological hazard... call Kadena Air Base..."\]

\[DR. TORRES's voice, distant: "...stable but we need burn unit... facial trauma... possible inhalation..."\]

\[Long stretch of ambient sound—alarms, radio static, water still running, someone breathing heavily.\]

\---

TIMESTAMP 00:38:48  
\[VIDEO RESUMES \- TRACKING ERRORS SEVERE\]

\[Visual: Lab is now illuminated by emergency lighting—harsh red. Water on floor. Scorch marks visible on walls. Several incubators are shattered. The coral specimens are... wrong. Even through degraded video, the shapes are wrong. Fleshy. Tumorous. Growing beyond their tanks in branching, vein-like patterns. One appears to be moving, pulsing independently.\]

\[DR. TORRES is sitting on the floor against a wall, lab coat removed, blood on her sleeves. Her face is composed but her hands shake as she writes in her notebook. The camera is still recording. She either forgot it was on or doesn't care.\]

\[WHITAKER is off-camera but audible—medical personnel are treating him. His voice is hoarse, broken:\]

WHITAKER: ...is it gone? Is it off me?

\[FEMALE VOICE—medic: "You're clean. Mostly. We decontaminated the affected areas. But your face..."\]

WHITAKER: I can't see. Why can't I see out of my left—

\[MALE VOICE—medic: "Don't touch the bandages. You're going to Kadena. They'll have better facilities."\]

WHITAKER \[sobbing\]: I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. Oh god, Ryan's going to—Dr. TORRES, I'm so sorry, I'm so—

DR. TORRES \[not looking up from her notebook, voice eerily calm\]: It's all right, EJ.

WHITAKER: It's not all right\! Look at this place\! Look at what I—

DR. TORRES: You made a mistake. We'll learn from it.

WHITAKER \[hysterical laugh\]: Learn from it? I could have killed us both\! I could have—those things in the tanks, they're not coral anymore, they're—

DR. TORRES \[finally looking up, directly at him—or where he must be off-camera. Her eyes are bright, intense, alive.\]: They're beautiful.

\[Long silence. Even the medics seem to pause.\]

WHITAKER: ...what?

DR. TORRES: You pushed too hard, yes. You violated protocol, yes. But look what happened. \[She gestures to the mutated coral.\] Uncontrolled cellular regeneration. Tissue modification. Adaptation to trauma. EJ, you didn't destroy the specimens. You transformed them.

WHITAKER \[voice small, confused\]: They're monsters.

DR. TORRES: They're data. And data is possibility. \[She returns to her notebook, writing with renewed focus.\] We'll shut down the trial publicly. File an incident report. Sanitize the site. But I'm keeping samples. Tissue cultures. Genetic material. Because you were right about one thing—

WHITAKER: What?

DR. TORRES: Some limits are meant to be broken. We just have to be smart about how we break them.

\[WHITAKER makes a sound—could be laugh, could be sob.\]

WHITAKER \[whisper\]: You're crazier than I am.

DR. TORRES \[slight smile\]: No. I'm just better at hiding it. \[pause\] Go get treated, EJ. Heal. And when you're ready, we'll talk about what comes next.

WHITAKER: There's a "next"? After this?

DR. TORRES: There's always a next. That's the beauty of evolution. It never stops. It just... adapts. \[She closes her notebook, finally looks at the camera, seems to remember it's recording.\] End documentation. September seventeenth, twenty-two fifty-three.

\[Visual: She stands, walks toward the camera. For just a moment before she reaches to turn it off, her face fills the frame. The expression is serene, maternal, terrifying. Behind her, the mutated coral writhes in its shattered tank, and the blue light pulses and glows and breathes.\]

\[RECORDING ENDS\]

\---

\[TRANSCRIBER NOTE: Remaining footage shows facility cleanup. Coral specimens removed by personnel in hazmat suits. Whitaker transported to Kadena AFB Medical Center with severe facial burns and possible radiation exposure. Dr. TORRES remained on-site for debriefing. Lab was decontaminated and sealed. Official incident report classified under ONR Special Access Program protocols.

The screaming. I've transcribed a lot of combat footage, medevac recordings, interrogation tapes. I've heard every kind of human sound. But Whitaker's scream when the coral—when whatever happened to him happened—that's the sound I hear when I can't sleep. It's not pain. Or it's not just pain. It's the sound of someone realizing they've become something they can't undo. Transformation doesn't ask permission.

Knowing what Subject C-1 becomes—what Cinder is now—this recording takes on a different weight. We're watching the birth of a monster. And we're watching Dr. TORRES decide that's acceptable. More than acceptable. \*Necessary.\*

She kept samples. The mutation signature matches Janus gene markers exactly. This wasn't just the genesis of an idea. This was proof-of-concept. EJ Whitaker burned so that TORRES could light the way forward.

\*\*RE: Incident C-447 and Future Research Direction\*\*

I should file a patent. That's what any reasonable scientist would do. Document the mutation process, the cellular transformation we witnessed, the radiological trigger mechanism. Submit it to USPTO, establish precedent, protect intellectual property.

I'm not going to file.

The patent office requires complete data sets and I could file preliminary but the ethical review board would demand full disclosure and funding cycles don't wait for bureaucratic approval and anyway—who would believe that coral regeneration research has military applications? Who would think to weaponize tissue modification? Who would imagine that we could encode adaptation itself, make evolution a choice rather than chance?

No one. Not yet.

But I see it. Standing in that lab, watching EJ scream as the coral fragments embedded themselves in his tissue, watching his flesh try to reject and accept and transform simultaneously—I saw the future. Not the future we're supposed to want. The clean one, the sustainable one, where we gently guide nature back to balance.

The other future. The necessary one.

We're not going to save the planet by being gentle. The climate is shifting too fast, the oceans are dying too quickly, and humanity won't change behavior until forced. We need adaptation on demand. We need evolution as intervention. We need to give survival a choice.

EJ's mistake—his beautiful, terrible mistake—proved it's possible. Cellular regeneration can be weaponized. Stress responses can be encoded. We can make organisms that thrive in catastrophe, that transform trauma into strength.

The coral didn't die. It became something new.

What if humans could do the same?

I'm calling it the Janus gene, after the two-faced god. One face looking backward at what we were, one face looking forward to what we'll become. The question isn't whether we should do this. The question is how we do it responsibly. How we build limits into limitless potential.

The Navy is already interested in EJ's "accident." I've received three calls from ONR special projects division. They smell weapon potential. Good. I need their funding, their facilities, their willingness to push ethical boundaries in the name of national security.

I'll pursue this independently at first. Small trials. Animal subjects. Perfect the gene sequence, understand the transformation mechanisms, build safeguards. And when I'm ready—when the world is ready—I'll offer humanity the choice: stay fragile, or become something that can survive what's coming.

EJ will heal. His face will scar. He'll carry the marks of this night forever. But he gave me the gift of proof. Passion without limits creates monsters. But passion with purpose creates miracles.

I won't file the patent because this knowledge is too dangerous to share openly. It's too valuable to risk someone else weaponizing it before I understand the full implications. This is my burden now. My passion. My limit.

The coral tanks were destroyed. Official record states all specimens incinerated. Official record is incorrect. I have samples. Tissue cultures in cryogenic storage. Genetic material that will one day become the foundation of human transformation.

Some limits are meant to be broken.

I'm going to break them all.

—Z.C.

\[Handwritten addition at bottom of page, different ink color—added later:\]

\*Note to self: Ryan left EJ. Couldn't handle the scarring, the trauma, the nightmares. EJ called me crying, asked why he sacrificed everything for science that "doesn't care about him." Told him science doesn't care about anyone. That's what makes it pure. He didn't find that comforting.\*

\*Should I feel guilty? I don't. I feel energized. We're building the future. Heartbreak is just another form of metamorphosis.\*

## [ARCHIVIST FINAL NOTE\*\*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1GSdz49ZarvuUSlovvXLORcwyMKnWMqAWmBGEZWE7jOg/edit)

\`\`\`  
These documents—the lab recording and Dr. TORRES's memo—appear disconnected from combat operations at first glance. Why archive a 1986 laboratory accident in a file system designed for tracking current Okinawa conflict assets?

The answer is simple and horrifying: this is where it all began.

Subject C-1 (Cinder) carries mutation markers identical to the coral specimens from Incident C-447. The Janus gene that powers every DARE Champion, every combat-adapted soldier, every bioweapon deployed in this war—it started with Dr. Zelda TORRES watching a young researcher burn and deciding that burning was beautiful.

One incident. One reckless experiment born from a young man's desperation to prove himself. One mentor's decision to see potential in catastrophe rather than tragedy.

And forty years later, we fight monsters that were born in that lab, carrying that code, expressing that same violent adaptation.

Passion doesn't redeem the harm it causes. Passion compounds. It transforms. It metastasizes.

TORRES is still alive as of this archive date (2026). She's 85 years old, residing in Providence Medical Center, still consulting on DARE program parameters. Still insisting her work serves humanity's future.

Still refusing to admit that her greatest discovery was also her greatest sin.

EJ Whitaker—Cinder—burns through Okinawa Prefecture, leaving ash and ruin, and somewhere TORRES watches the news coverage and sees vindication.

She chose our evolution. We live with the consequences.

## [Scorched Search](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1bQMDfMsi1gNDb-Mo9y70HkFcF8vHs8fikzBzq6hOrls/edit)

Shade’s journal

Tokashiki Island at night is like a tomb. In these times, unexpected clatterings and crashing makes it seem like the enemy is always with you in spirit presence. 

Sympathetic and desiring as little trouble as possible from any national military presence, a smaller night-black painted fishing vessel ferried me and other supplies from Furuzamami Beach at around 0011 hrs. The boat bounced through chop as if attempting to shake off all it had seen since the occupation began. Who knows how many wounded or dead it had transported? That choking smell of human humors mixed with attempted sanitation, made it smell like an airport latrine— a fragrant stench lingered. Combined with the constant bobbing, and my flip-flopping gut, there was no chance for sleep.

Good thing was there was no need to conceal myself. The middle-aged Chinese soldier (who seemed to be in-charge) wore a tattered PLA uniform with all insignia removed. I didn’t need to know any Mandarin to realize he had abandoned the fight. When I overheard a woman’s voice soothing a fussing baby behind his rusty cabin door, I understood why.

0318 hrs \- I arrived on Tokashiki. From Tokashiku Beach, its low mountains, silhouetted against the stars, intimidated me. They were the worn and slanted signs outside an vacant and crumbling prison. Me: the Urbex kid with a camera and guts, entering against all good sense. Okinawa at night is oppressive with repressed memory. More so during war.

But still I have to go in. Little brother is there somewhere. Just not sure if he’s the one looking for him, or the one looking for something else. Why did Timeera have to be so vague?

**0331 hrs \- Landing**

The captain cut the engine two hundred meters out. He wouldn't meet my eyes. I understood. Whatever was waiting on that island had a way of making men look away.

I dropped into water too warm, tasted fuel and something brackish underneath. The shoreline came into view as my Glassigs booted up. Not sand. Not anymore.

The burned part of the jungle looked like the island's skin had been broken. A giant's nail had scabbed the earth open—black streaks through the canopy that made it recall napalm fire from the war years. I thought about my grandfather's stories. Except—no, that wasn't right. That wasn't *my* grandfather. That was just the war talking, pressing down on this place like a hand that never let go.

My Glassigs warped immediately. DARE interference. The thermal overlay bled wrong colors, and the audio feed crackled like molten rock cooling, like whispering glass. I toggled off and on twice. Useless. The equipment couldn't parse what happened here.

**0346 hrs \- Into the Burned Zone**

I walked into the tunnel of destruction. A line of burned trees led inland, each trunk a blackened tooth. The path of fire had carved half-pipes of scorched nature, natural waste flushed toward the sea in some old violence I didn't understand yet. But I was starting to feel it.

Every step, the smoldering surface rose up through my boots. Heat that shouldn't still be there. But where the surviving jungle pressed in at the scars' edges, a cooling effect washed over me like someone was watching, or breathing. Both things at once. I kept moving.

The first melted armor was half-buried in char. I recognized it immediately. Scorch-class. Still warm. I collected what I could—three fragments, each one a piece of evidence I didn't want to be collecting. The data upload took thirty seconds. Thirty seconds too long.

Mission note: *He's not controlling it anymore.*

I stared at the words on my visor. Hated writing them. Hated knowing they were true.

**0410 hrs \- Avoiding the Main Road**

The occupation had checkpoints everywhere. I cut inland, away from the coastal routes where patrols moved. The jungle was denser here, less burned, but that didn't feel like mercy. It felt like the island was directing me somewhere specific.

I climbed toward the Kurama Street Observation Deck, staying off the main paths. The elevation gave me sight lines. Gave me distance from whoever was sweeping the lowlands.

**0417 hrs \- The Observation Deck**

The deck overlooked the burned scars—I could see them from up here, dark rivers cutting through the green. The view was meant to be beautiful once. Tourist spot, probably. Now it was just a vantage point where a man could watch what had been done to the island.

I sat and ate the Northern Spy apple. The sweetness had gone bitter, rot underneath the skin like something corrupted from the inside out. I thought about the captain's family—the baby's voice, the woman trying to soothe something in the dark while her man ferried a ghost across Kerama Blue waters. How many people on this island had to leave things behind? How many had to abandon pieces of themselves just to survive?

I spit the apple out.

Around 0441 hrs, I noticed the deck was moving.

Not moving. Vibrating. No—not vibrating. The ground beneath it was *shifting*. Subtle. Almost imperceptible. But I felt it in my bones, in my teeth. A deep, low sound came with it. Not sound exactly. More like the island itself was humming. Breathing. Something massive turning in its sleep beneath the soil.

I forced myself to stay still. To stay quiet. Like moving would wake it.

The Kerama Blue waters glowed faintly in the dark below. The burned scars looked like wounds that wouldn't close. The island kept humming—patient, maternal, endless—and I sat there on an observation deck meant for tourists, realizing I wasn't observing anything anymore.

The island was observing me.

By the time I tried to sleep, the ground was still moving beneath me. Slow. Deliberate. Like something vast was turning over, checking if I was still there.

## Scorch to Shade Communication

Gorillas are docile creatures, but a mask of their head always made for a terrifying Halloween. I was peeling layers of jungle, stalking quiet patrols around, sun trailing over tire tracks, when the face arrived.

It was a meme: shaggy black hair surrounding a rubber primate face with parted rosehip red lips around an air slit, two circular wells for eyes encouraged darkness. The words: "Gorilla Gone" were in white all-caps over the picture. Without candy, orange and black pumpkins, and the *Monster Mash* playing, seeing it there on this dangerous mission was an invasion. 

But I knew who’d sent it immediately.

*Scorch where are you?*

More sentries scan the area. I’m moving closer to the destination. Without thinking as much as I should about circling threats. It’s all sweat, swish, and grit. Occasional crouching and waiting. Charred scars of flaky jungle is the path I follow. Signs of Scorch are everywhere. I contemplate a DARE.

I imagine the conversation between us:

Shade: "Bro, what’s that meme about?"

Scorch: "It’s funny, right?"

"I don’t get it."

"Then don’t get it then. Doesn’t matter."

"It’s the mask."

"What mask?"

"The gorilla mask. Dad’s old one."

"Wasn’t that hard after all, to get it."

"What’s up with you smokin’ everything?"

"All black everything is why."

"You’re not making sense."

"Fumfer. Ha, that’s a funny word."

"What?"

"Phumpher— that’s what you doin’."

"Make sense bro. I ain’t got time for—"

"MUMBLIN’ that’s what it is. Goddamn\! Say it wit’ yo chest\!"

"Say what?"

"What you *really* want to say."

"Which is? You tell me since you already know."

"Because yo ass don’t know loyalty."

"Oh I don’t?"

"All that military shit didn’t give you shit."

"We both went to battle, our own fights."

"Yea but I stayed. You went. And I’m not talkin’ about just Okinawa."

"What is it then?"

"Look at this burnt streak. Look at it nigga\! You think I wanted this??"

"Of course not\!"

"Then hurry yo ass up and get back here."

"Scorch—"

I find myself at a series of friendly buildings. No one is around. But I see the top of a node protruding from the roof. Same construction as the one on Zamami. A trap? There’s no avoiding them here. 

## The Ember Lab

The air reeked of benzene and salt and heat long dead. The walls were stripped bare— steel exposed and oxidized black, consoles gutted and scattered across the floor. Each light that still flickered did so like it was remembering what brightness used to mean.

My GlassIG visor kept shorting. Every step made the deck plating groan, stress fractures spider-webbing under my boots. The deeper I went, the quieter it got—until even my breathing felt like noise.

Then I saw her.

Dr. Hino sat half-folded against a terminal, her legs pinned under a collapsed section of framework. Her skin had gone glassy, like it was trying to imitate what she studied. One amber eye, one gray. The look of someone who had stared too long into a flame.

"Dr. Hino," I said.

She smiled faintly. "You still call me that. I told you once—just Hino. You three never listened."

The words hit like shrapnel. Memories stirred—her voice echoing across sterile halls, calling us "my solar triplets" during drills, sneaking ration sweets to us when the med officers weren't watching. The weight of her hand on my shoulder when a simulation went wrong. *You're learning. You're safe.*

"You remember," she said. "Zelda said you might."

"I remember," I said quietly. "You took care of us."

Her laugh was dry, almost gentle. "Caretaker, handler, mother—whatever word they needed that day. You were all different then. Curious. Hungry for light. Not this…" Her hand twitched, as if trying to outline my silhouette. "Not what you've become."

What I'd become?

I crouched beside her. "Who did this to you?"

She didn't answer right away. Her gaze drifted to the charred impressions burned into her side—finger marks blackened deep into the skin. The burns spiraled, almost deliberate. Almost intimate.

"He did," she said finally. "Your brother. Scorch. But not the one you knew. He burned like he'd lost the idea of himself. *That* wasn't him, Shade. Scorch doesn't *burn* like that—not in his heart. He's good. I know it. Something else was burning through him. The fire was borrowed."

*She still believed in him.* Even now. Even scorched.

"I tried to stop him. He screamed for Zelda, or maybe at her. After that, the soldiers panicked—or they fired—or they prayed. It's all the same. And then they left."

"Left?"

"PLA sealed the node. Let it rot. Cinder stayed behind. Said she'd guard what was left of the Mother's work." Her voice cracked. "But Zelda's still here, Shade. She's at the base."

Her free hand trembled toward my face, then fell. For a moment, she looked like she wanted to reach for me—really reach. Her palm came up and she pawed awkwardly at my head, fingers splaying through my hair like she was checking its weight, its texture. Like she was remembering something.

"You always did have a good grade of hair," she said softly, almost to herself. "Even when you were scared. Even when the tests were hard."

Her hand dropped. Maybe she was afraid the corrosion had made her touch poisonous. Maybe she was just afraid of what I'd become.

"Did Zelda do this to you?" I asked.

"Zelda *is* this," Hino whispered. Her eyes unfocused, staring through the terminal behind me. "She's at the base. The facility breathes *for* her now—or she breathes for it. I can't tell anymore. She's waiting for you, Shade. She's been so patient."

Patience. The word landed wrong.

She reached for my hand, her grip weak but deliberate. "I thought I could shape you all into something better. Stronger. I thought if I loved you enough—studied you enough—science would teach me how to *mother* something the universe never meant to have children. That was my real fire, Shade. Not what Scorch carried. Not what Zelda became." Her laugh was ash-dry, bitter as smoke. "My blindness. My arrogance. I believed I could nurture the inhuman. I believed *I* could be enough."

She released me and gestured toward the floor beside her.

"Use this," she said.

Her fingers brushed a small metallic module—blackened around the ports, faintly humming. The metal was warm to the touch.

"SIG-S," she said. "A GlassIG upgrade. Your visor can handle it. You'll see them now—the frequencies they left behind. The heat they burned into this place. The marks they made when they stopped being human."

I took the module and locked it into my visor. The display shimmered, recalibrating. The world came alive in bands of violet and gold—heat signatures painted across the rubble like ghosts of violence.

And there—heat trails.

Scorch's path scattered and violent through the lab—wild, panicked bursts of thermal chaos. And another, steady and deliberate, moving with purpose through corridors that no longer existed. Precision. Intent.

Past the hollow consoles and twisted framework, deeper into the node's spine.

A circle burned into the far wall. Nine small dots orbiting in perfect synchrony. The solar wheel.

Sun's mark. He'd left his sign in the deep place, like a prayer burned into steel. Like a *claim*. Like a *name*. Astrological. Sacred. Personal.

I touched the symbol. The metal was still warm—or radiant—or warning.

"She's still here," Hino whispered behind me. "She's waiting."

Her voice was fainter now, words skipping like corrupted data. I turned back.

Behind me, Hino's breath rattled once, then stopped. Her amber eye fixed on nothing. Her body went still against the terminal, the weight of it final and absolute.

The terminal at her back flared once and died.

Somewhere beneath the wreckage, the ground quaked—slow, rhythmic, alive. Not random. Deliberate. An earth spasm.

Or waiting.

I followed the tremor toward the node's spine, past the hollow consoles and dead machinery, chasing the pulse that might still be my brother. The solar wheel burned behind me, nine orbiting suns marking the deep places where Sun had been.

The warm metal of the symbol still pressed against my skin like a brand.

Like a covenant.

Like a warning I'd already accepted.

## The Captain’s Conversation

What’s her kink, I wonder?

You think it’s creating life?

Maybe. These days everyone wants to be a mother. Everyone can be. That’s the way it is.

You’re not gonna explain that, are you?

What is there to explain?

Yeah I figured not. Sun?

What’s up?

You have to talk to them about your plan.

You’re right. Creating Lavanyah wasn’t enough for them to get the research. 

Ah her.

She was, or I suppose is, the perfect representation of what can happen when ingenuity meets general soldiering.

Heads up, we’re here. Talk to Zelda?

I don’t want to.

Why not? You followed Cinder for a reason. Watched him burn that kid, collude with the enemy, prolong the war and his overall yuk behavior— don’t tell me all that was for nothing.

Well, when you put it that way…

Hey, I’ve only lived for thousands of years, am the superconstruct of all your past lives, and live rent free in your head. Dozens of wars, whores, millenia of woes, and one learns a thing or two. You’ll see.

Mothers are the murderers of reason. Mothers are the makers of reason. Mothers are rememberers of reason.

Right you are. Okay we’re here. Remember your social skills.

Shut up.

—-  
"You’re looking quite unwell these days, Zelda."

(Cough cough) "Yes, yes I know. The body can never outpace the mind. This is true no matter how advanced we become."

"..."

"Can you come closer? My sight isn’t so good these days… okay that’s better. I’m surprised you came to see me. I hear the fighting is getting worse."

"Only as bad as the politicians want it to be."

"Still railing against the Machine are you? The mob?"

"It’s all the same."

"Depends on the class of mob. Sun, why are you here? You look different."

"I want to know about Project Charon."

## **\[CASE FILE TRANSCRIPT \- SUBJECT: SUN / SUBJECT: ZELDA\]**

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Interior medical facility, Kyoto sector. Subject Sun enters. Zelda is recumbent, life support systems audible. Environmental readings indicate: 22.4°C, medical-grade air filtration, trace pharmaceutical compounds in atmosphere.\]

**SUN:** You're looking quite unwell these days, Zelda.

**ZELDA:** (Cough cough) Yes, yes I know. The body can never outpace the mind. This is true no matter how advanced we become.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun remains in doorway. Silhouette. He does not advance immediately.\]

**ZELDA:** Can you come closer? My sight isn't so good these days… okay that's better. I'm surprised you came to see me. I hear the fighting is getting worse.

**SUN:** Only as bad as the politicians want it to be.

**ZELDA:** Still railing against the Machine are you? The mob?

**SUN:** It's all the same.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's hand moves across the blanket. Tremor detected. Subject's breathing pattern changes—recognition response.\]

**ZELDA:** Depends on the class of mob. Sun, why are you here? You look different.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun does not respond immediately. Cardiovascular elevation detected. Perspiration visible on neck/temple region. Subject approaches but does not sit.\]

**SUN:** I want to know about Project Charon.

---

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's breathing pattern shifts. Pause of 3.2 seconds before response.\]

**ZELDA:** That's a long time ago.

**SUN:** Not long enough. Not if it's still running on this island.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda closes eyes. Opens them. Dual-colored irises (amber/gray) catch ambient light sequentially.\]

**ZELDA:** I conceived of it as a framework. A way to ask: what if human potential wasn't limited by neurology? What if soldiers could think faster, feel deeper, choose better? My disciples heard only the first question. They built weapons.

**SUN:** Weapons that work.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun's jaw musculature contracted. Vocal register sharp. Not interrogatory—accusatory.\]

**ZELDA:** Yes. They work. That's what haunts me. They work so well that now everyone wants them. Now I am the architect of necessity.

\[ARCHIVIST NOTE \- Project Charon Genesis: Initiated 2031 as classified framework for cognitive enhancement and somatic optimization. Original parameters emphasized voluntary participation and ethical bifurcation protocols. By 2035, three separate militaries had weaponized the framework independently. By 2039, C-unit designation emerged from Shanghai facilities—first successful integration of Charon protocols into combat personnel. Program was no longer experimental. It was doctrine.\]

**ZELDA:** Come. Sit with me a moment. You're standing like you're ready to leave.

**SUN:** I'm not here to sit with you.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda does not look away. Subject Sun's body language indicates conflict—muscular tension suggesting forward movement, then suppression.\]

**ZELDA:** I know. But I'm old, and my eyes are poor, and I'd like to see my Sun's face while we talk. Is that too much to ask?

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun's body shifts toward chair. Muscles flex. Subject catches himself. Turns away. Arms cross. Distance increases. Rejection of maternal reaching.\]

---

**SUN:** How did you lose it? How did it slip away from you?

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun's vocal register contains undertone beneath anger. Disappointment detected. Subject's body language suggests need for maternal omniscience—desire for Zelda to have been in control.\]

**ZELDA:** Because I believed that if I explained myself clearly enough, everyone would understand the difference between enhancement and domination. I was naïve.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda coughs. Wet. Old. She continues.\]

**ZELDA:** The vision fractured the moment it left my mind. Shanghai interpreted it one way. Washington another. Now Tokyo. Three nations, three religions, all built from my blueprint.

**SUN:** So you failed.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: No hesitation in Sun's statement. No qualification. Fact delivered as accusation.\]

**ZELDA:** Yes. I failed. And Sun... you're angry with me for failing. But you're angrier with yourself for needing me not to fail.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject Sun's jaw tightens. Averts eye contact. Classification: defensive response to emotional exposure.\]

**SUN:** It's not—

**ZELDA:** It's alright. I would be angry too.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Room ambient noise: life support hum. Subject Sun's breathing audible—controlled but at threshold. Military discipline suppressing animal response.\]

---

**SUN:** I need more than what D.A.R.E. gives me. I need the next level. I need what you built into the framework but never released.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's pupils dilate. Recognition response. Not surprise—acknowledgment. Subject has been anticipating this line of inquiry.\]

**ZELDA:** Ah. So you're already enhanced. They let you in.

**SUN:** Yes.

**ZELDA:** And it wasn't enough.

**SUN:** It's not about enough. It's about what's necessary. There's a war to end, and I—

**ZELDA:** You want to end it alone. You want to carry the world on your back so no one else has to.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Sun turns toward window. Averts direct eye contact. Defensive posture.\]

**SUN:** Don't psychoanalyze me.

**ZELDA:** I'm not analyzing you, Sun. I'm recognizing myself.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda extends hand toward subject. Tremor in extremity. Subject Sun steps backward. Distance increases. Physical rejection of maternal contact.\]

**ZELDA:** That need to solve everything. That belief that if you just become strong enough, smart enough, perfect enough, you can fix what's broken. It destroys you. It will destroy you.

**SUN:** You're not in a position to lecture me about destruction.

**ZELDA:** No. I'm in a position to warn you. There's a difference.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda waits. Extended pause—7.4 seconds. Subject Sun does not respond. Zelda grants spatial and temporal allowance.\]

**ZELDA:** Tell me what you want to know.

---

**SUN:** There's something in the D.A.R.E. framework. Something locked behind genetic thresholds. Bifurcation protocols. I need access. How do I unlock it?

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's breathing pattern changes. Becomes shallow. Recognition of Sun's true purpose.\]

**ZELDA:** The name they're calling it now is the Janus gene. Named after the two-faced god. One face looks inward. One outward. One is the soldier. One is... you.

**SUN:** How do I activate it?

**ZELDA:** You can't. Not safely.

**SUN:** Zelda—

**ZELDA:** No. Listen to me. When you bifurcate like that, you don't integrate. You become a partition. Two things in one body, each fighting for dominance. The soldier wants to endure. The man wants to rest. The soldier wants victory. The man wants peace. They war inside you. They always will.

**SUN:** I can control it.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's body stiffens. Flinch response. Not from pain—from inevitability. Subject is hearing her own younger voice speak through Sun's voice.\]

**ZELDA:** No, you can't. Because I couldn't. I bifurcated myself decades ago. I chose the visionary. I let the rest—the mother, the woman, the one who could stop and simply *be*—I let her starve.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Tear fluid detected on Zelda's facial surface. Subject's vocal register indicates emotional clarity rather than weakness.\]

**ZELDA:** I wanted to create soldiers to end wars, but soldiers need wars to justify themselves; wars justify themselves through soldiers—and I knew this. I knew this. And I did it anyway. Don't you see? Don't you see what I'm trying to tell you?

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject Sun remains silent. Perspiration visible on temples/anterior regions. Military discipline at critical threshold.\]

**ZELDA:** You're going to make the same choice I did. And look at us, Sun. Look at what I became. Look at what you're becoming. You're going to spend centuries believing it was necessary. You're going to spend centuries being right. And you're going to spend centuries alone.

**SUN:** At least I'm making a choice. At least I'm not pretending it's philosophy.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda recoils as if struck. Subject does not physically advance, but vocal impact registers measurably on Zelda's physiological response.\]

**ZELDA:** You're right. You're more honest than I was. That's something. Come here. Please. Before it's too late. Just... come here.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject Sun's body indicates internal conflict. Muscular tension toward forward movement detected. Legs flex. Shoulders shift forward. Internal struggle between maternal pull and defensive armor.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject's defensive structure holds. Sun does not advance. Does not move. Distance maintained.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's arm falls. Her breathing becomes labored—physiological response to emotion and illness intermingling.\]

**ZELDA:** The access codes. They're in the encrypted files under my medical records. Biometric lock. Your DNA should open it. I wanted you to ask. I wanted you to need me for something other than answers.

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject Sun enters frozen state. Approximately 2.3 seconds elapse.\]

\[DOOR BREACH DETECTED: Subject Scorch enters. Velocity high. Tactical posture. No hesitation parameters detected.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's eyes open. Gaze contact with Subject Sun established. Approximately 1.1 seconds of mutual recognition before violence commences.\]

**ZELDA:** Sun—

\[VIOLENCE PARAMETERS INITIATED. Subject Scorch. Target: Zelda. Efficiency rating: maximum. Completion: immediate.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Life support systems cease. Ambient hum terminates. Silence.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Zelda's dual-colored eyes (amber/gray) cease visual processing. Subject is no longer responsive to stimuli.\]

\[CAMERA OBSERVATION: Subject Sun remains in position. Immobile. Access codes mentioned by Zelda constitute informational inheritance now possessed by Sun. Encryption protocols transferable via biometric authorization.\]

---

## **\[ARCHIVIST INTERPRETATION \- FINAL\]**

*Subject Sun's isolation is now compounded. The only figure capable of reaching him—or whom he was capable of reaching—has been terminated. The physical inheritance she offered (access codes, Janus gene activation protocols) has been secured. The emotional inheritance she offered (recognition, warning, motherhood) has been rejected and is now permanently inaccessible. Subject stands in a room with a corpse, holding the keys to his own bifurcation, understanding finally that he will spend centuries alone—not because of circumstance, but because of choice. His choice. Her choice. The only choices available in a world built by people like them.*

*This is the tragedy of enhancement. Not that it fails. But that it succeeds.*

Recovery Note: Found in Lt. Matsumoto's desk after her emergency medical leave (panic attacks, insomnia, acute stress response). Added to official archive per Protocol 7-7-7 (Archivist Mental State Documentation). This entry was written after 47 consecutive viewings of surveillance footage from Sector 4, Camera 19-B.

\---

I can't stop watching it.

The timestamp is burned into my retinas: 23:14:03. Three brothers. One body. One choice that breaks them all.

The surveillance footage is corrupted—thermal interference, electromagnetic distortion from Subject C-3's heat signature. I can see shapes. Movements. Orange fire-glow. But I can't see their faces. Can't see the exact moment Shade's world ends. Can't see Sun's perfectly controlled mask finally crack.

The audio is pristine. Every word. Every breath. Every silence that says more than speech ever could.

So I'm writing it down. Reconstructing what the video won't show me. Using the psych profiles, the family histories, the Janus integration reports. Using the audio to guide me. Using my imagination to fill the gaps.

This isn't protocol. Commander Reyes would have my clearance revoked if he knew. But I can't sleep. Can't eat. Can't stop hearing Lock scream "I was fifteen" over and over.

I need to understand how three brothers who loved each other ended up here.

Here's what I think happened:

The rest of the transcript can't describe the horror of the attack.

A fire so hot I check my skin for burns. Scorch executed conclusively. Zelda's skinned charred then flaked in the vent breeze. Black snow fluttered around the lens. Mouth open, eyes clenched in final agony, she no longer breathed or struggled. Her brilliant mind darkened forever.

For a time, Sun stood there looking at the wall and so did Scorch viewing his kill. I had to fast forward then rewind to the point where they faced each other. Two brothers who rarely (if ever) saw eye to eye on any issue spoke unkind words poised to attack.

"Why?" Sun asked with shakiness in his voice.

"Because she made me like this. I didn't sign up to be some monster\!"

"Perhaps you already were one."

"What\!? Fuck dat supposed to mean\!?" Scorch flared fire from his hands. The eyes were without light.

"You heard me."

"Say somethin’ else then\! Say another godDAMN word."

"..."

"See, see that's what I thought. Got nuthin' to say, cuz you know I'm right. You know all dis shit is cuz of her, right? The C-Unit, being stuck here on this godforsaken island, fuck, prolly even the war itself, all downstream from her fucked up experiment."

Sun stepped forward. "It wasn't your call to make."

"Well, I made it for you, for us."

"No. You did it for your own selfish reasons. Though I have no idea what those are and I don't really give a shit."

Then the screen flashes and Scorch screams.

"Bro\! Bro\! You gotta help me\! It burns\! I'm fuckin’ burnin’ up\! Do something\!"

Sun doesn't move. And that's when the third brother Shade arrives.

\*\*No problem at all\! Here's the complete scene from where you left off:\*\*

Then the screen flashes and Scorch screams.

"Bro\! Bro\! You gotta help me\! It burns\! I'm fuckin' burnin' up\! Do something\!"

Sun doesn't move. And that's when the third brother Shade arrives.

Shade stepped through the smoke like a ghost materializing from thought itself. No sound. No warning. Just there—standing between the body and his brothers, between the killer and the witness.

For a moment, all three of them were still.

Sun stared at Shade with the hollow expression of someone watching a play they'd already memorized. Scorch stared at Shade like he was seeing salvation. And Shade—Shade stared at the blackened shape that used to be Dr. Zelda Torres and felt something ancient and cold settle into his chest.

"Help me," Scorch said again, but this time it wasn't a scream. It was a plea. "Please, Shade. It \*hurts\*."

Shade didn't move. His voice came out flat, empty. "What did you do?"

"What I had to—"

"What. Did. You. \*Do\*."

Scorch's hands ignited, fire curling around his fingers like living things trying to escape. His eyes were wet, wild, jumping between his brothers. "She made us into this\! Into fucking \*monsters\*\! I didn't ask for this shit\! I didn't—" He doubled over, clutching his stomach. Smoke rose from his mouth when he gasped. "It's getting worse. The heat. It's inside me and I can't—I can't make it stop—"

"Good," Sun said quietly.

Scorch's head snapped up. "What?"

"I said \*good\*." Sun took a step forward, and for the first time, Shade saw real emotion crack through that cryptic, distant mask his oldest brother always wore. Rage. Pure and cold and terrible. "You wanted to be a monster, Lock? Congratulations. You're succeeding."

"Fuck you, nigga," Scorch spat. Literally—embers fell from his lips. "You don't get to judge me. You \*chose\* this. You signed up to be their super soldier poster boy. I got \*drafted\* into hell."

"We all got drafted," Shade said, finally finding his voice.

"Bullshit." Scorch wheeled on him, flames crawling up his arms now. "You could've said no. Both of y'all could've said no. But you didn't, because you wanted this. You wanted to be special, to matter, to be more than just—"

"More than what?" Sun's voice was sharp. "More than another fucked-up kid from a fucked-up family? Yeah. I did. And you know what? So did you."

"That ain't—"

"You followed her around like a lost puppy," Sun continued, relentless. "Every time she walked into a room, you'd light up like—" He stopped himself, but too late.

Scorch's flames flared white-hot. "Like \*what\*? Say it."

"Nothing."

"Nah, nah, you started, so finish. Like what?"

Sun's jaw clenched. "Like a kid looking at his mother."

The temperature in the room spiked.

"You don't know shit about—" Scorch started.

"I know she wasn't your mom," Sun said flatly. "I know you made her into something she couldn't be. You needed too much from her."

"And you didn't need \*anything\*," Scorch shot back. "That make you better? Calling her 'Doctor' like she was some stranger instead of the only person who gave a damn whether we lived or died?"

"I respected her position—"

"You were scared," Scorch said. "Scared to get close. But at least you got an excuse—you were already gone before shit got bad. You left first." His eyes slid to Shade. "But \*you\*—"

Shade felt his stomach drop.

"You don't get to say shit to me," Scorch continued, and now his voice was pure venom. "Not after what you did."

"Lock—"

"You were \*there\*," Scorch said, flames climbing higher. "When Dad died. You were home. We both were. And then—"

His voice cracked but he pushed through it.

"And you left anyway."

The words hung in the smoke-filled air.

"Six months," Scorch said quietly. "Dad was gone six months and you couldn't wait to sign up, to get the fuck out, to leave me—"

"I was trying to help—"

"HELP?" Scorch's fire exploded outward. "Nigga, I was \*fifteen\*\! I was fifteen years old and you left me alone in that house with all Dad's shit still in the closets and Mom's pictures still on the walls and you just—you just fucking \*left\*\!"

"I sent money—"

"I didn't need money\!" Scorch screamed. "I needed—" He stopped himself, breathing hard. "I needed you to stay. Just once. Just \*once\* I needed someone to actually fucking stay."

Shade couldn't speak. His throat was closed.

"Sun gets a pass," Scorch continued, looking at their oldest brother. "He was already enlisted when Dad—when it happened. He couldn't come back. I get that. But you?" His eyes fixed on Shade again, wet and red and accusing. "You were there. You helped me pack Dad's stuff. You were at the funeral. You looked me in the eye and said we'd get through it together."

"We did—"

"Then you enlisted three months later," Scorch finished. "Signed up for Janus six months after that. And I was alone. So yeah, when Zelda showed up and gave a damn, when she actually \*stayed\*, I held onto that. And you can judge me for it all you want, but at least I didn't abandon—"

"That's enough," Sun said quietly.

Both brothers looked at him.

"He's right," Sun said, and his voice was flat, empty. "About me leaving first. About—" He looked at Shade. "About you leaving him when he needed you most."

"I was eighteen—" Shade started.

"And he was fifteen," Sun interrupted. "And you were all he had left."

Shade felt something hot and defensive rise in his chest. "What was I supposed to do? Stay in that house? Watch him fall apart? I couldn't—I didn't know how to—"

"So you ran," Scorch said simply. "Like you always do. And then you kept running. Took every field assignment, every deployment, every excuse to stay away—"

"I was doing my job—"

"You were hiding," Sun said quietly.

Shade turned to him. "What?"

"You heard me." Sun's voice was clinical now, distant. "You were hiding from Dad's death. From having to take care of Lock. From having to be the one who stayed. So you volunteered for everything, stayed deployed for months at a time, and when Zelda wanted to run tests, wanted you here for integration—you found reasons to leave."

"That's not—"

"And I wasn't any better," Sun continued, cutting him off. "I was already gone. Already building my career, my reputation. I came back for the funeral and left again two days later because I couldn't—" He stopped, swallowed. "I couldn't handle it either. Couldn't handle seeing Lock try to hold it together. Couldn't handle the empty house. So I left too."

He looked at Scorch.

"We both left you," Sun said quietly. "And you're right. That's on us."

Scorch's flames flickered, died down slightly. For just a moment, he looked like a kid again—young and scared and so desperately alone.

Then his face hardened.

"Doesn't matter now," he said. "Dad's gone. Zelda's gone. We're all that's left and we can't even—"

"You remember Gunstar Heroes?" Shade said suddenly.

Scorch blinked. "What?"

"That old Sega game. We used to play co-op in the barracks. You, me, Sun. Back before—"

"Before everything went to shit?" Scorch finished. "Yeah. I remember."

"You always picked the flame," Shade said softly.

Something flickered across Scorch's face. Not quite grief. Not quite recognition. Something in between.

"We were good at that game," Sun added quietly. "Could beat it with our eyes closed."

"We covered each other," Shade said.

The three of them stood there, and for just a heartbeat, they weren't monsters or soldiers or experiments.

They were just brothers.

Then Scorch laughed, sharp and broken. "Yeah. We \*were\* good. Past tense." He looked at his burning hands. "But look at us now."

The lights went out.

Not flickered. Not dimmed. \*Out\*. Complete and instant darkness except for the fire still consuming Scorch's body, casting everything in hellish orange-red.

Then they heard it.

Footsteps. Heavy. Methodical. Coming from the corridor outside, each impact deliberate, patient, \*wrong\*. The sound of something that was pretending to be human but had forgotten the rhythm.

All three brothers froze.

"Shade," Sun said quietly, his hand going to his weapon. "Tell me you have eyes on—"

"Nothing," Shade whispered. He was scanning, reaching out with whatever senses the Janus gene had given him, trying to feel the shape of the threat. But there was nothing. Just void. "I can't read it. It's like trying to see through smoke."

Scorch's flames dimmed instinctively, reducing to a low burn. For the first time since Shade had arrived, his youngest brother looked genuinely afraid. "No. No no no, he wasn't supposed to be here yet, the intel said he was still in Sector 7, we had \*time\*—"

"Who?" Shade demanded.

The footsteps stopped.

In the silence that followed, they heard breathing. Not human breathing. Too wet. Too deep. Like lungs filled with ocean water trying to remember how air worked.

Then the door exploded inward.

\*\*Cinder\*\* stood in the doorway, and Shade understood immediately why Scorch was afraid.

The thing that had been Dr. Clive "EJ" Whitaker was seven feet of nightmare biology. Coral growths emerged from his skin in branching patterns—not decorative, but structural, like his skeleton was trying to grow outside his body. One eye was human, brown and wet and filled with too much intelligence. The other was a cluster of polyps, each one containing a tiny pupil that moved independently. His face—what was left of it—had been beautiful once. Now it was a fusion of flesh and calcified reef, frozen in an expression that might have been agony or ecstasy or something humans didn't have a word for.

He wore the remains of a tactical vest, but the straps had been modified, cut away to accommodate the coral growth. Weapons hung from him—blades, a sidearm, something that looked like a harpoon gun—but Shade suspected those were just for show. The real weapons were biological.

Cinder's working eye fixed on Scorch.

"You," he said. His voice was a chorus—multiple vocal cords, or maybe the coral itself resonating, creating harmonics that made Shade's teeth ache. "I can smell her on you. Burnt flesh. Calcified bone. The scent signature is identical to—"

His gaze traveled past Scorch. Past Shade. To the body.

Everything stopped.

Cinder stared at Dr. Zelda Torres's corpse with his human eye and his coral eye and all the tiny pupils swimming in polyps, and Shade watched something break inside him that couldn't be put back together.

"No," Cinder whispered. The chorus-voice was gone. It was just him now. Just EJ. "No, she wouldn't—she can't be—"

He took a step forward. Then another. Moving like a man underwater, slow and disbelieving. Scorch backed away immediately, fire surging back to life in panic. Sun raised his weapon but didn't fire, calculating angles, threats, trying to find the tactical answer.

But Shade just watched. Because he recognized what he was seeing.

Grief.

Cinder knelt beside Zelda's body. His armored, coral-encrusted hand reached out—so careful, so gentle—and touched what was left of her face. His fingers came away with ash and char, and he stared at them like they were a language he'd forgotten how to read.

"Thirty-eight years," Cinder said quietly. "I knew her for thirty-eight years. Since 1986\. Since the accident that made me—" He gestured at himself with those ruined hands. "—this."

He looked up at the brothers. All those eyes—human and coral, singular and plural—fixed on them with an intensity that made Shade's skin crawl.

"You think you knew her," Cinder said. "You think because she made you, because she ran your treatments, because she—" His voice caught. "Because she cared about you. You think that means you understood who she was."

"We didn't—" Sun started.

"Let me tell you who she was," Cinder interrupted. The chorus-voice was back now, layered and strange. "To each of you. Since you were too busy arguing about your own pain to see hers."

He looked at Sun first.

"You," Cinder said. "The oldest. The first success. You think she kept you at arm's length because you respected her position?" He laughed, wet and bitter. "She kept you distant because you reminded her of what she could do when everything went \*right\*. You were proof that the theory worked, that Janus integration could create something perfect. And every time she looked at you, she saw her redemption. Her justification for what she did to me."

Sun's face went carefully blank.

"But you couldn't handle being her masterpiece," Cinder continued. "So you called her 'Doctor' and filed reports and kept everything professional because if you let her be your mother, you'd have to admit you \*needed\* her. And you couldn't do that. Couldn't be vulnerable. Couldn't be anything less than the perfect soldier she designed."

He turned to Shade next.

"And you," Cinder said. "The middle child. The one who ran. You think you were hiding from Dad's death, from having to take care of Lock, from the responsibility of being the one who stayed." He shook his head slowly. "You were hiding from \*her\*. From the way she looked at you like you were a problem she couldn't solve. Because you weren't quite as successful as Sun and you weren't quite as broken as Lock, and that made you \*invisible\*. The data point in the middle. The control variable."

Shade felt the words hit like physical blows.

"So you volunteered for field assignments," Cinder continued, relentless. "Stayed away for months. Made yourself \*useful\* instead of present. Because if you weren't here, she couldn't see that you were just... average. Just a soldier who happened to survive the treatment instead of transcend it."

Then Cinder's gaze—all of his gazes—fixed on Scorch.

"And you," he said softly. "Lock. The baby. The one who needed too much."

Scorch's flames flickered but he didn't speak.

"She loved you the most," Cinder said, and the words hung in the air like accusations. "Did you know that? Out of all of you, all the C-Unit subjects, all the experiments and trials and iterations—she loved \*you\* the most. Because you needed her. Because you looked at her like she was salvation instead of science. Because you gave her what she'd been chasing since 1986."

"What?" Scorch's voice was small.

"A second chance," Cinder said. "A chance to be the mother she never got to be. A chance to save someone instead of destroying them." He looked down at his coral-encrusted hands. "She couldn't save me. The accident happened too fast, the integration went too far. By the time she stabilized my condition, I was already—" He stopped. "Already this. But you. You she could still shape. Still guide. Still \*fix\*."

"She didn't fix me," Scorch said bitterly. "She made me worse. She—"

"She made you a \*son\*," Cinder said, and now there was something raw in his voice, something that sounded like envy. "She gave you everything I wanted. Everything I \*needed\*. Attention. Care. Time. She stayed up with you through the fevers. Sang to you when the pain got bad. Held you when you thought you were dying."

He stood now, towering over them all.

"Do you know what she did for me during my integration?" Cinder asked. "She took notes. She measured my vitals. She documented my screaming for the research files. Because I wasn't her son. I was her \*mistake\*. The proof that she needed to be more careful, more precise, more controlled."

"That's not—" Shade started.

"It's exactly true," Cinder said flatly. "For thirty-eight years, I was her guilty conscience. Her cautionary tale. Her reminder that she wasn't God, no matter how much she wanted to be. And I accepted that. I made peace with being the monster in her closet because at least—at \*least\*—she never forgot about me. Never stopped trying to understand what went wrong so she could make it right with the next generation."

He looked at Scorch again.

"And then you came along," Cinder said quietly. "You and Sun and Shade and all the others. The C-Unit. The children she got to keep. The sons she actually wanted." His voice was barely a whisper now. "Do you have any idea what it's like to watch someone love the person you could have been?"

Silence.

Then Scorch spoke, his voice shaking. "If you hated us so much, why didn't you just—"

"I didn't hate you," Cinder interrupted. "I envied you. But I didn't hate you. Because she asked me not to."

He pulled something from his vest—a piece of paper, old and worn, folded and refolded so many times the creases were soft as cloth. He held it up so they could see her handwriting, even if they couldn't read the words from this distance.

"She wrote me letters," Cinder said. "Every month for thirty-eight years. Telling me about her work. About the progress. About—" His voice cracked. "About you. About how Sun was brilliant but distant. How Shade was capable but conflicted. How Lock was struggling but trying so hard to be brave."

He refolded the letter with impossible gentleness and put it back.

"She told me you were family," Cinder continued. "That even though I couldn't be there, even though my condition made me too dangerous for the main facility—you were still my brothers. That we were all her children, even if we came from different failures."

Shade felt something tight in his chest. "EJ—"

"She asked me to protect you," Cinder said, and now the grief was unmistakable, naked and raw. "In her last letter. Three days ago. She said the integration was getting harder to control, that Lock was deteriorating faster than expected, that there was a risk of—" He looked at Scorch. "Of catastrophic failure."

Scorch flinched.

"She asked me to come," Cinder said. "To help. To be ready in case—in case she needed me. And I said no."

The words fell like stones.

"I said no," Cinder repeated. "Because I was tired. Because I'd spent thirty-eight years watching her build a family I wasn't really part of. Because I wanted—just once—for her to need me more than she needed her perfect subjects. So I stayed in Sector 7\. And I let her die alone."

His human eye was streaming tears now. The coral eye leaked that bioluminescent fluid, glowing tracks down his mutated face.

"So when you three stand here arguing about who she was to you—about who failed her, who loved her, who needed her most—remember this:" Cinder's voice dropped to something cold and final. "She was my \*teacher\*. My torturer. My creator. My colleague. My friend. My mother. My punishment. My redemption. She was everything I ever had and everything I ever lost. And I knew her longer than your entire lives combined."

He looked at Zelda's body one last time.

"And I still couldn't save her."

The silence that followed was absolute.

Then Cinder's gaze fixed on Scorch, and something in those multiple eyes changed. Hardened.

"But I can give her justice," he said quietly.

Scorch tried to run.

He made it three steps before Cinder moved.

Cinder's speed was \*wrong\*. Not fast like Sun's enhanced metabolism. Not tactical like Shade's training. It was the speed of a sea creature striking from dark water—alien, impossible to predict, violating every rule about how mass and momentum should work.

He caught Scorch by the ankle. The coral growths on his hand flexed, \*opened\*, revealing structures that looked like sea anemone tendrils. They wrapped around Scorch's leg and Shade heard his brother scream—not from fire this time, but from something else. The coral was \*injecting\* something. Paralytic. Or venom. Or genetic material that would turn flesh into reef given enough time.

Scorch's flames went supernova in panic. The entire corridor lit up white-hot, metal melting, walls buckling. Any normal person would have been atomized.

Cinder held on.

His coral armor smoked and blackened but didn't break. Steam rose from his body, hissing and shrieking, but underneath, Shade could see the tissues \*regenerating\*. Growing back as fast as they burned. Faster.

Cinder pulled Scorch back toward him like reeling in a fish, inexorable, and Shade saw real terror in his youngest brother's eyes.

"Shade\!" Scorch screamed. "Shade, please—SUN—somebody—"

Shade moved without thinking.

He shadow-stepped behind Cinder, blade already drawn, aiming for the gap between coral plates at the base of the skull—

Cinder spun and caught his wrist without looking.

The polyp-eye had seen him. All those tiny pupils, independent, giving Cinder three-hundred-sixty-degree vision. Shade felt something crack in his forearm—not broken, not yet, but close.

"Don't," Cinder said softly. His human eye fixed on Shade now, filled with something that looked like disappointment. "Please don't make me hurt you too. She wouldn't want that."

"Let him go," Shade said through gritted teeth.

"Why? So he can burn his way through the rest of the base? So he can kill everyone else who tries to help him?" Cinder's grip tightened and Shade felt his bones creak. "She \*loved\* him. More than she loved me. More than she loved any of us. And this is how he repays her?"

\*\*BANG.\*\*

Sun's gunshot caught Cinder in the shoulder—not the coral-armored part, but a gap where human flesh still showed through. Blood sprayed. Black and wrong, mixed with something that glowed.

Cinder dropped both Shade and Scorch, staggering back. His head swiveled toward Sun with predatory focus.

Sun ejected the magazine, slapped in a new one without looking, his eyes never leaving Cinder. "Run."

But Scorch was already gone—scrambling to his feet and vanishing down the corridor in a trail of flame and smoke and panic. Running like he'd been doing his whole life.

Shade pushed himself up, coughing. His wrist throbbed but it was already healing, the Janus gene knitting bone and tissue. He looked at Sun, then at Cinder, then made his choice.

He stayed.

Cinder touched his wounded shoulder. Looked at the blood on his fingers. The wound was already closing, coral growing over the bullet hole like living scar tissue.

When he looked back at them, both eyes were dark.

"He runs," Cinder said in that chorus-voice again. "Of course he runs. Coward to the end."

"He's scared," Shade said.

"So am I," Cinder replied. "So was she. Fear doesn't excuse murder."

\*\*CRASH.\*\*

Something exploded through the wall behind them—big, fast, announced by roaring jets and the stink of aviation fuel. A PLA combat mech, eight feet tall, bristling with weapons. It must have been tracking Cinder's biosignature, following the trail of his unique genetic markers.

It opened fire without warning.

Thirty-millimeter autocannon rounds chewed through the corridor. Shade shadow-stepped on instinct, dissolving into darkness as tracers burned through where he'd been standing. Sun moved with enhanced speed, rolling behind cover, already returning fire.

But Cinder—

Cinder didn't dodge.

He turned toward the mech with something that looked almost like \*gratitude\* on his mutilated face, and Shade suddenly understood.

Cinder wanted this. Wanted the fight. Wanted to hurt something the way he was hurting.

The mech's pilot had maybe two seconds to register what was happening before Cinder closed the distance. His movement was wrong—not running, but \*flowing\*, his body moving in ways that violated anatomy and physics. The coral growths on his back extended, became tendrils, became weapons.

They punched through the mech's cockpit glass like tissue paper.

The pilot screamed. The scream ended when Cinder pulled him out—helmet, harness, everything—and threw him into the opposite wall hard enough to turn bone to paste.

Then Cinder tore the mech apart.

Shade had seen a lot of things in this war. He'd seen soldiers do impossible things under stress. He'd seen Janus subjects perform feats that rewrote biology textbooks.

He'd never seen anything like this.

Cinder moved through reinforced titanium like it was cardboard. Each strike pulverized metal, shattered hydraulics, crushed circuitry. The mech tried to respond—spinning up its rotary cannon, deploying smart missiles—but Cinder was already inside its guard, already past its defensive protocols, already \*everywhere\*.

In fifteen seconds, the mech was scrap.

Cinder stood in the wreckage, covered in hydraulic fluid and gore and his own glowing blood, breathing hard. The bioluminescence from his coral growths pulsed in the darkness—blue-green light that made him look like something from the deep ocean, something that had never seen the sun.

He turned back to the brothers.

"More will come," he said flatly. His voice was pure chorus now, all the grief buried under tactical assessment. "This facility is compromised. You need to evacuate."

Shade helped Sun to his feet. His oldest brother had taken shrapnel from the mech's explosion, blood seeping through his tactical vest, but the Janus gene was already working. He'd live.

"What about you?" Shade asked.

Cinder looked at him. Both eyes empty now. Hollow.

"I'm going after Lock," he said simply. "He doesn't get to run from this. He doesn't get to escape consequences." He turned toward the corridor where their youngest brother had fled, following a trail only he could see. "You can try to stop me. But I don't recommend it."

"She wouldn't want this," Sun said quietly.

Cinder stopped. Didn't turn around.

"She's not here to want anything anymore," he said. "Lock made sure of that."

He started walking. Each step deliberate, patient, inevitable.

Shade and Sun looked at each other. No words. They didn't need them. Brothers communicated in the spaces between language, in the things they didn't have to say.

Shade thought about Scorch. About fifteen-year-old Lock, alone in that empty house. About the kid who needed someone to stay and got abandoned instead.

Then he thought about Zelda. About thirty-eight years of letters. About a man turned monster who still called her every month just to hear her voice.

About family— blood and chosen and created— and all the ways it could save you or destroy you or both.

Sun nodded once.

Shade nodded back.

They followed Cinder into the dark.

The hunt had begun.

# Vs. Cinder (Shade’s Account)

Cinder’s first attack was an alarm at 2AM. No time to prepare or defend, just pure reaction speed. I leapt aside. Sun backflipped crazy. 

"You killed her\! The three of you\! I won’t forgive or forget. This flame will deliver burning punishment. Now die\!"

The Glassigs picked up melting heat sigs. Sun fired his rifle, but the molten man was a lunger, and dissolved the rounds.

I took cover in the fast blackening remains of the lab to reach him and Cinder fired hot jets at us. Sweat and soot seemed everywhere.

"We have to Dare\!" I said.

"Agreed\! Now?"

"Now\!"

I held my rifle horizontally. Sun produced his knife. Soon it was sword-length. He swung it hard on my outstretched rifle producing a TANG\! sound that sizzled. Eclipse burst blinded Cinder, then followed up with a shot. For a critical second, his raging fire went campfire, and he cried out.

That opening was all we needed. Sun moved first—always does—while the bustle of Cinder's desperate retaliation filled the lab with impossible heat. The ground under his feet cracked and ran like wax. I pressed forward, muscle memory and something older driving me now, something that had no name but answered to *her*.

*Finish it, Shade— he's breaking, can't hold the form together, the heat's consuming him, look at the seams in his body where the rage is eating through the structure, look look look—*

I fired. Sun's knife came down in that peculiar arc we'd drilled a thousand times. The blade caught Cinder's shoulder. My round caught his chest.

For a moment—and I mean truly a moment, that pocket of time where everything suspends—Cinder stood there, and I saw him. Not the flame. Not the vengeance. Just a man burning from the inside out, finally understanding there was no coming back from this.

Then there was nothing but embers and a sound like glass breaking underwater.

Sun stood there breathing hard, knife still extended. The lab hummed its death-rattle around us.

"Scorch did this," I said. Not a question.

Sun lowered the blade. That was worse than anger. "Yes."

"He's still out there."

"He is." Sun finally looked at me, and his eyes had that quality they get when he's decided something irreversible. "Your brother is redeemable, Shade. I want to believe that. I do." A pause—not hesitation, but finality. "But if I encounter him again, if he comes at me again—I'll kill him. No mercy. No second chances."

My face didn't move.
