Scorch / Lock Kiever (Youngest)

Limit: The limit of identity under siege.

He starts resentful, haunted by survivor’s guilt, and through the monster’s possession he literally de-evolves. His strength, his body, his memory — stripped away.

His arc is about gratitude: can he see himself not as failure or leftover, but as still a brother, still someone with meaning, even altered?

His communication (jokes, physicality) masks fragility. His limit is whether he can face himself when the masks are gone.

Node tie: N1–2 (voice and body control), N4 (memory), N6 (alteration).
