## **Backstory**

Zane Zygote was born in a dying Australian mining town, the kind built to be temporary and then quietly forgotten. His mother raised him on half-truths and relocation plans, always one creditor—or something not entirely human—ahead of whatever she owed. His father died early, only to reappear years later as Zane’s most persistent rival: same face, different body, same hunger to win. No one ever explained how that was possible. Everyone acted like it wasn’t happening.

Zane learned young that the safest way to survive was to never fully exist on paper.

He became boring on purpose. Wealthy by accident. A thief who stole not for need, but for leverage—locks, spells, secrets, and favors. He drifted between cities, accents bleeding into each other, voice rasped raw from smoke and long nights talking too much in languages he never claimed as his own.

When the government program found him, they didn’t pitch it as fatherhood. They pitched it as distance. A one-time biological contract. No names exchanged. No future claims. Total deniability.

Jinhua was presented to him as a viability test, not a woman. Her body was framed as a system. Her womb as a question mark. Zane didn’t ask why she had been chosen. Asking questions had never kept him safe before.

The irony came later. Against protocol, he noticed details. Against instinct, he stayed longer than required. Against every survival rule he had ever lived by, he felt something like loyalty trying to form—quiet, inconvenient, and dangerous.

When the child took, the handlers praised the data. Zane felt only guilt—clean, sharp, and unshareable. He disappeared immediately after. That was the deal.

Now, years later, fragments of his name surface in sealed files and cult whispers. His rival wears his father’s smile. His mother is still hiding. And Zane—once chosen precisely because he would vanish—finds himself wondering whether plausible deniability is just another word for cowardice, and whether friendship, loyalty, or even fatherhood are competitions you lose the moment you try to win them.
