## **Rohan “Sun” Haven (eldest)**

* **Core Traits**: Cerebral, calculating, almost obsessed with control. He sees himself as the strategist, the one who must *become* the perfect soldier at any cost. His aura is commanding but carries the weight of sacrifice.

* **Keywords**: **Caravan** (journey, carrying others’ burdens), **Volt** (energy, precision, sudden strikes), **Veldt** (wild expanse, the battlefield as his home).

* **Personality Notes**:

  * Holds himself apart, both admired and feared by his brothers.

  * Rarely wastes words — he speaks like every sentence is part of a chess game.

  * Deeply values order, but suppresses emotion to maintain it.

  * His drive to embody perfection estranges him from the others, even though they orbit his “light.”

Son / Rohan Havid (Oldest) — The Captain

Limit: The limit of power without purpose.

He wants to evolve, to transcend limits through augmentation, but he has no telos — no ground beyond “become strongest.”

His strength risks becoming empty spectacle, an idol to the very powers destroying Okinawa.

His proxy-communication style reinforces this: he is always mediated, never fully present. His limit is whether he can be truly human in the midst of perfection.

Node tie: N3 (Hive), N5 (Chimera), N7 (Immortality).

## Scene Appearances

| Scene Title | Role | Summary |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Monument (Ch.6)** | **God of Destruction** | **Sun** arrived at the Yonaguni Monument with overwhelming, singular power—crushing the waves flat and bending light around him. He obliterated **Cadence** with a single beam of coherent light, inadvertently critically wounding **Zima** in the crossfire, then stood atop the Monument awaiting what comes next. |
| **Flotilla Destruction (Ch.8)** | **Apocalyptic Force** | **Sun** destroyed the joint US/China naval blockade singlehandedly, bisecting destroyers and frigates with forked light beams while walking on water—an act of devastation that forced **Shade** to contemplate fratricide as the only remaining option. |
| **Scorch vs. Sun (Ch.9)** | **Unyielding Strategist** | **Sun** warned **Scorch** to stop his interference at the Yonaguni Monument, viewing him as an impediment to destiny, before an unknown force struck the pyramid and sent it back into the depths. |
