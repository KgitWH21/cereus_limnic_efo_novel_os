## **Background & Timeline**

* **Teen years (Cereus & Limnic, , Cereus & Limnic: Second Evolution (2062), Sync Whole (2064))**:

  * Smart, curious, quiet, model-student archetype.

  * Narrowly survives encounter with a **data cult** that worships data/AI.

  * Her survival elevates her into an **unwitting religious figure**. She never wanted this status, but it clings to her.

* **Young adulthood (\~19 in Sync Whole, Age 31 by Type B (2076)):**

  * Still grappling with aftermath of cult survival and her reluctant deification.

  * Becomes the **archivist**, piecing together her father’s (Li Ma) buried past.

  * By this time Li Ma has died; she investigates decades-old Okinawa events (~50 years past).

  * Gains access to a **nightmare case file**: scattered, contradictory reports, photos, testimonies.
  * **Cadence Dossier:** Reviews the file of Subject 734-C, confronting the "Casualty Engine" and the systemic horror of Chrysalis's creations.

  * Works under **time pressure** (e.g., father’s legacy under scrutiny, potential award or public challenge) to solve mystery and protect his memory.

---

## **Personality & Voice**

* **Core traits:** Quiet, measured, cautious, curious, studious.

* **Voice as teenager:** Careful, curious, deferential, with flashes of rebellious intellect.

* **Voice as archivist:** Mature, deliberate, heavy with responsibility; factual on the surface, but shadowed by dread and doubt.

  * *“I was taught to trust records, but records are as fragile as the people who write them. My father wrote none of these. I don’t know if I can trust a silence this loud.”*

* **Narrative style:** Blends clinical record-keeping with personal unease. Observations start precise, then unravel into haunted reflection.

---

## **Flaws & Humanizing Quirks**

* **Distrustful:** Questions others’ motives, often to the point of isolation.

* **Self-sacrificing:** Takes on burdens alone, unwilling to share the weight.

* **Haunted by sainthood:** Dislikes being worshipped, yet resents being ignored; torn between anonymity and unwanted reverence.

* **Intellectual pride:** Believes she can untangle any record/system, but underestimates chaos and chance.

* **Fear of intimacy:** Wary of closeness post-cult; reserve calcifies into coldness.

* **Quirks:**

  * Compulsively smooths or aligns papers when stressed.

  * Writes and rewrites marginalia, unable to leave notes imperfect.

  * Small, nervous gestures (tapping pen, biting lip) betray her quiet facade.

---

## **Thematic Role**

* **Bridge between past and future:** Connects her father’s war story (*Type A*) to her own investigation (*Type B*).

* **Burdened witness:** Forced to interpret a fractured record, aware her own flaws distort the truth.

* **Legacy vs. autonomy:** Struggles with her father’s shadow and her cult-born sainthood.

* **Horror lens:** Her notes frame the story with dread, as if history itself resists being told.

---

## **Symbolic Resonance**

* **Archivist as priestess:** Records function like scripture; her annotations carry the weight of sacred or forbidden text.

* **Silence as inheritance:** What she cannot know about her father becomes as defining as what she discovers.

* **Memory as wound:** History refuses to close, festering through her notes.
