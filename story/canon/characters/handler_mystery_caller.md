## **🎭 Character Stub – Handler (Mystery Caller)**

**Codename:** \[Handler placeholder\]  
 **First Appearance:** Massage scene (phone call to Tamira Koi).

**Role:**

* Tamira Koi’s contact/mission handler. Provides intel, sets logistics, delivers mission details.

* Functions as both mission support and source of personal tension.

**Traits (as established so far):**

* **Intimate Betrayer vibe:** knows Tamira too well, weaponizes familiarity.

* Possible **shared past**: long-time coworkers; implied fling or at least personal entanglement.

* **Mutual leverage:** both know details about each other that cross agency policy; stalemate dynamic.

* Tone: dry, clipped, but layered with intimacy (lines like “You still grind your teeth when you’re nervous?” / “No mistakes this time.” / “Cute.”).

* Presence adds menace through subtle familiarity, not exposition.

**Potential Narrative Uses:**

* Recurring foil/ally with ambiguous loyalty.

* Relationship ambiguity builds tension: is he trustworthy, rival, or future betrayer?

* Can become a mirror for Tamira’s own flaws and secrets.
