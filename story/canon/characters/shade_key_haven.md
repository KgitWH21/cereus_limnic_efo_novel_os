Shade (Key Haven) (Middle, POV)

Limit: The limit of control and unity.

He wants to keep the family whole, but his grasping becomes a weakness. He can’t dictate what brothers become, nor hold back the tide of war.

His arc is patience and acceptance: to face the truth that unity can’t be forced.

His communication style (direct talk, action) reflects his desire for clarity and fixes. His limit is learning to live with ambiguity and letting go.

Node tie: He touches all (as POV), but especially N4 (Identity) and N6 (Ethics).
