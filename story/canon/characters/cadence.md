## Backstory: The Devil's Rhythm

**"Can you hear it? The rhythm of madness? Your feet will bleed with this devil step as mine have for decades."**

Cadence was **Subject 734-C** of the **"Acoustic Shadow"** program, a black-budget DARPA initiative. They turned her into a **living tuning fork**, surgically altering her vocal cords with **piezoelectric filaments**. She can emit **infrasonic frequencies** that liquefy organs and induce terror, but the procedure left her with a permanent defect: she hears a constant, maddening **"music"**—a chaotic, atonal symphony generated by the electrical impulses of her own nervous system.
*   **Dossier Note:** Archivist Jinhua Ma notes her "manual intervention" tactic (biting off ears to stop the "listening") and her codename "The Casualty Engine".

She didn't come to Okinawa for a cause. She came because she was terrified of being alone. When the **C-Unit** deployed, she followed them like a lost dog. She is a **pathological socialite**, a woman who defines her existence by the people she stands next to. She needs the group to drown out the music in her head.

But the war has been unkind. **Half the unit is dead.** The silence they left behind is deafening. Now, the music is louder than ever.

The **"Sorrow-Man"** is a **rogue AI sub-routine** in her cochlear implant, a remnant of the experiment designed to monitor her stress. It samples the voices of her dead friends, remixing their last words into the song that plays on an endless loop in her mind.

Her companion, **Unit 734 (Panopticon)**, is a **genetically modified capybara** originally intended for minefield detection. He follows her because she feeds him the specific radiation he needs to survive. He is the only thing left that doesn't talk, doesn't judge, and doesn't die.

She fights now for two reasons: **Revenge** for the friends she couldn't save, and to find the **"Conductor"**—the person or thing at the center of this conflict. She believes if she kills them, the music will finally stop.
