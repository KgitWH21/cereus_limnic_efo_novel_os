**[0200 HOURS]**

We've been on the water for hours. But I knew we were followed from Kumejima.

Cadence pursued us through sound. 

My guess was Timeera's condition gave us away. She pilots the vessel to distract herself.

The Engine was a problem. I don't know much about boats or sailing, but excessive black smoke didn't seem like a good sign. 

More disturbing still was the enemy craft didn't increase it's speed to catch up. Once it got within a comfortable distance, it cruised, following as sure as the sun rotated to setting.

It felt more like an escort than pursuit.

But the signal is out there. I can feel it—a pressure in the air, a static charge that makes the hair on my arms stand up. Cadence is sweeping the sectors, looking for a pulse, looking for us.


**[0500 HOURS]**

Yonaguni.

I see the silhouette against the stars—a dark wedge of rock rising from the sea.

We made it. Barely.

The Engine is smoking, and the hull is taking on water. The Signal is still there, but we're in the shadow of the island now. The rocks mask us.

"Beach it," I say.

"What?"

"Beach it. We're sinking anyway."

The old man nods, grim. He aims for a strip of sand between the cliffs.

We hit hard.

The trawler groans as metal shears against rock. We are thrown forward, and I hit the console hard. Darkness takes the edges of my vision.

Silence returns.

I open the door, and the air smells of salt and wet stone.

We arrived on Yonaguni. Cadence isn't far behind.

**MISSION STATUS:** LANDFALL ACHIEVED. ASSET CRITICAL.
**NEXT OBJECTIVE:** LOCATE CONTACT. SURVIVE.
