Ch 2. Prisoner of Record
Recordings only contain “what” memories, not why and how. Finding those takes time we don't have, and much gentler circumstances. Escape is a vector with zero magnitude at present. Time for me to make some. But how?

This row of cells stinks like a cat box overfilled. I was thinking that when I saw an orange flare of heat flash down the hall of the stone corridor. There's be no flaring or flying out of here for me. I'd already tried for hours and nothing worked.

Two guards dressed in specialized enemy drab uniforms dragged my brother down the corridor in chains. From the slick reflection of the material on their gear and full headcovers, which had only a single slit for a visual field, the suits were made of some fire resistant coating.

At first Scorch was limp. The scrape of his legs across the rough surface made me wince. But as they unlocked the cell, his eyes snapped open and he began to writhe in his restraints.

“Lemme out and let's see how long yo pussy asses last!” Flash went the fire around him. But the two soldiers didn't flinch. They'd been prepared for the outburst. Probably selective hands, specifically trained for this detail.

Scorch almost got the upper hand, but they used some type of metal rod with arcs of electricity cracking at the ends to beat him into the cell with me.

“Beware high voltage. The stick waits to those who act rashly.” This had been in one of my recent recordings. Though guardians had gone quiet since Yonaguni, they weren't without their signature mysterious irony. It almost made me laugh. So far I had avoided being zapped and thwamped, but my fiery brother wasn't so lucky. “No how or why, just a fuzzy cosmic road map in my reflection was all I had to follow.”

After another false flare, Scorch took a zapper to the side and vomited. When he hit hands and knees, the two guards just stood and watched him scream and cry out. Not one to learn a lesson in one try, Scorch stood with a spurt of flame as if he were a lighter out of fuel.

“That all? C'mon you bitch. Do it again. I fuckin dare you.”

The guards were statue scary. They seemed sentries of museum ambition animated for this purpose alone. When they each struck him, I nearly looked away. I wanted to. But I forced myself to watch as I replayed the recording in my mind for another clue. Nothing.

“That all!?”

Again he received strikes to the body. The hits weren't enough to kill, just indoctrination to a readjusted hierarchy of domination.

“More!”

Blood on the floor.

“More!”

Flare fails. Light glows across the room like a TV left on.

“MORE!”

This went on until the sentries' uniforms were soaked with sweat. After securing our cage, they stood watching my youngest brother’s crying whimpers, and me seemingly subdued in the corner. They stood frozen and facing us for at least another hour until they returned to whatever put of hell they'd come from.

Day nor night didn’t exist here. Just timestamps in the last recording I made prior to capture were the only unit of measure. The way I thought about it, after the Battle of the Brothers, we’d been captured near sunset and given some kind of drug inhibitor, sealing our abilities. Transport lasted anywhere from two to three hours by low altitude, lightweight aircraft, probably a small airlift drone– fast but not too visible. We’d been escorted out of the craft in chains by the two jailer sentries with hellish eyes. A foehn-like wind washed across my face reminding me of those Santa Ana breezes of Southern California. Wet air, palm trees, and the smell of ocean, returned me to the island. I overheard one of the guards mention Miyako. I didn’t know it well, but I remembered Cinder mentioning there was a node located here. There was much marching then continued movement, to a van with the blue print over white background of a U.S. government plate, then to another unmarked facility I could name or place because by that time it was too dark. Inside, a harsh-faced Black woman took account of any personal items we had, then we were subject to the indignity of stripping before the dead-eyed guards. Upon seeing us declothed, declawed of any means of retaliation, the worst part was they didn’t laugh or make jokes. They didn’t say anything. They might as well have been looking at a blank piece of paper or a wall. Somehow no reaction was worse than taunting, threatening, or any other terrifying possibility. 

Someone in a white coat conducted a cursory medical exam, then the two guards maintained tight lips as they donned rubber gloves. A ruthlessly invasive inspection commenced. They found nothing, but it was the only time I cried out. The taller guard, who was dark skinned as well, I noticed his lip twitch upward when it happened.

This whole process took maybe an hour or two. I know because the recording I memorized had played at least three to four times. At about 30 minutes in length, it was just simple math. Then we reclothed in black prison jumpsuits with no underwear and walked to a shared cell. Like so many of us before, we’d become prisoners. There was a crawling familiarity to the ordeal. “The cage that bars you will not bind you. Your soul is free.” That line from the recording stuck with me. But it did not mollify the fear.

After review from a man in an immaculate twilight blue uniform with a white mask, they went for Scorch first. But I stepped in front of
