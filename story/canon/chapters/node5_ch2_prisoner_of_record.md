Ch 2. Prisoner of Record
Recordings only contain “what” memories, not why and how. Finding those takes time we don't have, and much gentler circumstances. Escape is a vector with zero magnitude at present. Time for me to make some. But how?

This row of cells stinks like a cat box overfilled. I was thinking that when I saw an orange flare of heat flash down the hall of the stone corridor. There's be no flaring or flying out of here for me. I'd already tried for hours and nothing worked.

Two guards dressed in specialized enemy drab uniforms dragged my brother down the corridor in chains. From the slick reflection of the material on their gear and full headcovers, which had only a single slit for a visual field, the suits were made of some fire resistant coating.

At first Scorch was limp. The scrape of his legs across the rough surface made me wince. But as they unlocked the cell, his eyes snapped open and he began to writhe in his restraints.

“Lemme out and let's see how long yo pussy asses last!” Flash went the fire around him. But the two soldiers didn't flinch. They'd been prepared for the outburst. Probably selective hands, specifically trained for this detail.

Scorch almost got the upper hand, but they used some type of metal rod with arcs of electricity cracking at the ends to beat him into the cell with me.

“Beware high voltage. The stick waits to those who act rashly.” This had been in one of my recent recordings. Though guardians had gone quiet since Yonaguni, they weren't without their signature mysterious irony. It almost made me laugh. So far I had avoided being zapped and thwamped, but my fiery brother wasn't so lucky. “No how or why, just a fuzzy cosmic road map in my reflection was all I had to follow.”

After another false flare, Scorch took a zapper to the side and vomited. When he hit hands and knees, the two guards just stood and watched him scream and cry out. Not one to learn a lesson in one try, Scorch stood with a spurt of flame as if he were a lighter out of fuel.

“That all? C'mon you bitch. Do it again. I fuckin dare you.”

The guards were statue scary. They seemed sentries of museum ambition animated for this purpose alone. When they each struck him, I nearly looked away. I wanted to. But I forced myself to watch as I replayed the recording in my mind for another clue. Nothing.

“That all!?”

Again he received strikes to the body. The hits weren't enough to kill, just indoctrination to a readjusted hierarchy of domination.

“More!”

Blood on the floor.

“More!”

Flare fails. Light glows across the room like a TV left on at night.

“MORE!”

This went on until the sentries' uniforms were soaked with sweat. After securing our cage, they stood watching my youngest brother’s crying whimpers, and me seemingly subdued in the corner. They stood frozen and facing us for at least another hour until they returned to whatever pit of hell they'd come from.



Day nor night didn’t exist here. Just timestamps in the last recording I made prior to capture were the only unit of measure. The way I thought about it, after the Battle of the Brothers, we’d been captured near sunset and given some kind of drug inhibitor, sealing our abilities. Transport lasted anywhere from two to three hours by low altitude, lightweight aircraft, probably a small airlift drone– fast but not too visible. We’d been escorted out of the craft in chains by the two jailer sentries with hellish eyes. A foehn-like wind washed across my face reminding me of those Santa Ana breezes of Southern California. Wet air, palm trees, and the smell of ocean, returned me to the island. I overheard one of the guards mention Miyako. I didn’t know it well, but I remembered Cinder mentioning there was a node located here. There was much marching then continued movement, to a van with the blue print over white background of a U.S. government plate, then to another unmarked facility I couldn’t name or place because by that time it was too dark. Inside, a harsh-faced Black woman took account of any personal items we had, then we were subject to the indignity of stripping before the dead-eyed guards. Upon seeing us declothed, declawed of any means of retaliation, the worst part was they didn’t laugh or make jokes. They didn’t say anything. They might as well have been looking at a blank piece of paper or a wall. Somehow no reaction was worse than taunting, threatening, or any other terrifying possibility. 

Someone in a white coat conducted a cursory medical exam. Stethoscope to the chest, blood pressure, a hard slap in the face for a saliva sample after our jaws were left hanging loose: the whole charade reminded me of World War II enlistment videos highly lacking any usable investigative depth. They asked no questions because they already knew all our personal information I assumed. Then the two guards maintained tight lips as they donned rubber gloves. A ruthlessly invasive inspection commenced. It took three guards to turn Scorch and hold him to the hardly smoothed coral-rock wall as he screamed and spit NO, NO, FUCK YOU! I kept my eyes at the floor to suck the tears back in my sockets before my turn came. It was bad, but I expected worse. Still very bad though. Top 3 worst days of my life easily. They found nothing of course, but it was the only time I cried out. The taller guard, who was dark skinned as well, I noticed his lip twitch upward when it happened.

This whole process took maybe an hour or two. I know because the recording I memorized had played at least three to four times. At about 30 minutes in length, it was just simple math. Then we reclothed in black prison jumpsuits with no underwear and walked to a shared cell. Like so many of us before, we’d become prisoners. There was a crawling familiarity to the ordeal. “The cage that bars you will not bind you. Your soul is free.” That line from the recording stuck with me. But it did not mollify the fear.




“You will spend an unknown period of time under the metal.”

The meaning of this channeled statement was abstract at first. However, it only took a few hours to become clear. Probably around early morning, ±12-16 hours, they came for us. Or I should say he came for us.

Between our two G.I. Joe torturers, who I swear were cultured in a muddy swamp of sadness, and sprayed down with uranium composite to instill that inhuman instinct along their nerves, there was a new guy.

Clearly outranking them, this man wore an immaculate twilight blue uniform. But his face was covered with a white mask. He eyed a recovering Scorch, then turned his eyes on me. I heard the drip of water above, it was raining again.

“Do you know who I am?”

Everything was a test there. Passing was impossible. The only way to survive was to fail as few times as I could. I chose not to respond.

“That’s a ‘no’ then. You and your brothers have been a… problem for many in these islands. Whole nations are hunting for you. I should get a medal for that extraction.”

Though his voice was calm the way he said ‘hunting’ and ‘medal’ there was an edge of excitement to it. I half expected cameras to come on to begin some type of live broadcast to tell the world of our capture and perhaps, our execution. This was how legends were born.

“Remaining silent is a good strategy. But it won’t be so for long. Trust me.” With his left hand he snapped and one of the thugs got the keys and opened the cell. I instinctively backed toward the wall. I wouldn’t make a Dare here. Not now, not yet. I still couldn’t, though I hated to admit that to myself.

Scorch uncurled from his position of recovery. “Ah again huh? Nigga just can't get a break today.”

In three steps, half the distance of a regulation three-pointer on a fair basketball court (11 feet), I stood between these foreboding Black dudes and the stranger who was my brother. When one struck me on the shin, with the electric stick, I sunk my teeth into my lower lip, and kneeled. But my eyes stayed locked on. My biggest miscalculation was not anticipating the pain.

The second guard pulled back for another swing, but White Mask raised a hand and stopped him.

“You'll only delay his turn, not defeat it. And yet you volunteer?”

I stood up straight as possible. Ignoring the bone knocking pain was hard. Probably hardest thing I've had to do pain wise. But I managed to stay up and erect myself.

“Spoken like a true first born.”

The two guards faced him, but he hadn't issued any command. Telepathy? Cybernetic implants? Or maybe they were machines molded as flesh? I needed more data.

White Mask said, “Take him. Extract the gene. Get whatever else you can out of him.”

Another bash to the chest hit hard, making me cough. “Under the medal, under the medal” My stamina wasn't as high as it used to be. They hefted me up and dragged. But not before White Mask had a final word.

“Let's see, how strong that first born energy will last, Lawrence Haven.”

My lunge at him happened by reflex. The guards didn't flog me, but their grasp cinched harder.

This man knew me, probably all of us. No one had called me by that name in decades.
