# Chapter 6: The Monument

**FILE ID:** INDIGO-SEQUENCE-06
**OPERATIVE:** "Shade"
**LOCATION:** Yonaguni Monument, Submerged Ruins [Surface Breach]
**DATE:** 2026-XX
**STATUS:** CRITICAL FAILURE

---

**[0900 HOURS] - VISUAL CONFIRMATION**
**SUBJECT:** GEOLOGICAL ANOMALY / THE MONUMENT

**OBSERVATION:**
On the beach before the monument is where we met her. Cadence was onion-shaped. Body stretched lumpiness with her shaggy fur capybara companion by her side. Turned out the craft she followed us in was a skiff, no larger than a two-person fishing craft. Confrontation was inevitable.

**ENVIRONMENTAL READINGS:**
According to the Glassigs: Atmospheric pressure is abnormally low. Pressure in the air is the detonating kind.

**UNIT STATUS:**
*   **Operating:** S. Key Haven (Self), L. Key Haven (Scorch)
*   **Critical:** T. Koi (Timeera). Respiration is wet, consistent with fluid in the lungs. She is a dead weight against my shoulder. Every step she takes is borrowed from a future she likely will not see.
*   **Active:** Zima. Positioned on flank. Combat ready, though visibly dwarfed by the scale of the anomaly.

**[0903 HOURS] - CONTACT**
**SUBJECT:** C-UNIT MEMBER "CADENCE"

**NARRATIVE RECORD:**
Scorch ordered a halt. His voice was stripped of its usual manic edge. He wasn't looking at me. He was fixating on a figure standing on the lowest tier of the risen stone.

Subject identified as Cadence.

**VISUAL ASSESSMENT:**
Subject appears frayed. Resembles a wire stripped of insulation, sparking at contact with the air. Accompanied by biological asset (Capybara). The animal is chattering—a low, grinding sound that registers on the lower frequencies.

**TRANSCRIPT:**
> **CADENCE:** "You're late." (Subject is tracking non-existent aerial phenomena). "The music. It's so loud here. Can't you hear it? It’s a riot."
>
> **SHADE:** "Cadence. We need extraction. Now."
>
> **CADENCE:** (Laughter, fractured). "Extraction? You think we're leaving? No, Shade. We just got to the venue."

**ANALYSIS:**
Subject is mentally compromised but lucid regarding the environment. She gestured to the massive stone structure behind her.

> **CADENCE:** "Look at it. The Tetum have a word. *Milagre*. A miracle." (Subject tilts head, listening to internal stimuli). "A *milagre*, you'd call it. I call it a fresh grave."

Scorch engaged. Heat signatures spiked around his shoulders—a haze of distortion warping the air.

> **SCORCH:** "I don't care what you call it. Get out of the way, or I'll burn you out of it."
>
> **ZIMA:** "Don't."

> **CADENCE:** 

COMBAT RECORD (CON’T)

The Capybara dashed, bent on orthopedic devastation. I Dared it with Moon Shot. A direct quiet shot in the air at a Glassigs verifired trajectory.

A few seconds later, the round impacted the animal’s hard skull with a crack. SUBJECT’s ally was down.

Exposure rising.

TRANSCRIPT

**CADENCE:** My friend! 

**SCORCH:** That damn thing ain’t fit for a cookout. You next bitch!

**SHADE:** Scorch get back!

**ZIMA:** Be careful!

**CADENCE:** Your ears will bleed at this sorrow song!

COMBAT RECORD (CON’T)

SUBJECT slapped her stomach and sung a dark song. The was chanting devil music, sounding like a known melody played in reversed and slowed to a sluggish speed on a heavily scratched CD.

The nausea thrust a fist at my gut. I saw Scorch projectile vomit in the sand, the flare red hot. He was losing it and I thought we may not win this.

TRANSCRIPT

**SCORCH:** Nigga we dare, now!

**SHADE:** Yeah

COMBAT RECORD (CON’T)

It was ROCK POP we chose unconsciously. Just hurl yourself at the target as if you’re jumping over pillows onto that old waterbed. Scorch leapt up, a rotating ball of flame. I did the same with the crushing gravity of the moon. 

We hit with simultaneous energy. Coral bones sharded the air.

Cadence took the impact with slight defense.

When we recovered. She was holding her side but not down.

Helicopters and boats approached the beach; flapping, roaring.

Overexposure at max.

**[0905 HOURS] - ANOMALY DETECTED**
**SUBJECT:** SUN ROHAN HAVEN
**EVENT:** SPATIAL DISPLACEMENT

**LOG ENTRY:**
The world didn't slow down. It ceased.
Atmospheric pressure dropped instantly. Visual distortion confirmed: the waves around the monument were crushed flat by an invisible hand. The sky shifted to a spectrum of absolute lightlessness.

**ARRIVAL:**
Subject Sun did not approach. He occupied the space that had been empty a microsecond prior. Displacement complete.

**THREAT ASSESSMENT:**
To classify Subject Sun as "powerful" is an error in scale. He is a singularity.
**METAPHORICAL INDEX:** Subject carries the weight of a collapsing star in his chest. A density of presence so immense that light bends around his perimeter, seemingly terrified to touch his skin.
**AUDITORY ANALYSIS:** Note that if Subject had spoken, the decibel level would have likely shattered the island's spine. His stillness strikes louder than the ocean.

**IDENTIFICATION:**
Visually matches Brother.
Energy signature matches Nuclear Event.
Psychological Profile: Cold Logic.

**[0906 HOURS] - ENGAGEMENT**
**ACTION:** OFFENSIVE DISCHARGE

**TRANSCRIPT:**
> **SUN:** "Rohan." (Speaker: Shade. Volume: Inaudible).
>
> **SUN:** "Imperfection."

**EVENT DESCRIPTION:**
Subject Sun raised a hand. No gesture. No flair. Efficient movement.
A beam of coherent light erupted. Target: The Monument.
Blast radius: Excessive.

**CASUALTY REPORT:**
*   **Scorch:** Blown back. Status: Disoriented.
*   **Shade:** Thrown to knees. Status: Functional.
*   **Zima:** **CRITICAL**.

**INCIDENT ANALYSIS:**
Zima stood her ground. Mistake.
The edge of the blast impacted her position. No vocalization. Impact sound: Wet/Heavy. Subject Zima spun—physics akin to a ragdoll in a hurricane—and impacted the stone steps.

> **SCORCH:** "Zima!"

**POST-ACTION OBSERVATION:**
Sun lowered his hand. Turn rate was mechanical. He observed the casualty. Blood is staining the ancient stone darker.

> **SUN:** "Collateral. Acceptable."

**CONCLUSION:**
The family unit is not merely broken. It is pulverized.
I am looking at Scorch scrambling towards Zima. I am looking at Cadence laughing silently at the sky. I am looking at the brother who has become a god of destruction.

**GAME STATE:**
Checkmate.
