“I want to slow down and spend more time with you, to get to know you. I promise I will.”

Ultimately this was a promise he wouldn’t keep. And there I was sitting on the phone with him, with the record of Okinawa fuming around me. Surrounding any form of mental escape from its influence from the past to this future… my future.

“Jinhua, are you still there?”

“Yes Zane, I’m here.”

“What’s on your mind? It’s not like you to be distracted so much.”

He used to wear a jacket with a golden revers on the few occasions we went out. On the third time I asked him why he wore such a flashy thing. “It’s my way of being creative. Just a small thing. Y’know when you do boring work like work in an office, donning your suit and tie, it chokes off your specialness. Besides, creating a new thing is a higher form of communicating, than just stating facts.”

I’d smiled at him at that line. I even felt a tug of love below my navel for him. That led to our first time together. One of three. The only one when biological demand took control over logical reason.

“Yeah, sorry. Just been working a lot lately.”

“I see… “

These silences bring in awareness of noises: whirring air condition, a slosh of digestive activity, lights buzzing like bugs; I wish I had more to say to mask it all.

“Still enveloped in the file are you?”

“...”

“I'll take that as a yes. I can help—”

“No. I don't need it.”

“I… understand.” He cleared his throat for no reason other than to add another sound to my ear. It became warmer and I could feel the strain of my bladder commanding me to end the call.

“I'm in the States. Was hoping I could stop by to visit.”

“Why?”

“I have something important to give you.”

Like a quick thumb swipe of an old smartphone, I ran over the possible list of things he could have that I'd want at this point. Upon first glance, none seemed appealing.

“Whatever it is, I'm not interested.”

“I think you will be.”

“What is it? Tell me.”

The files scrunched in as if eavesdropping.

“I'll have to show it to you in person. It's about your father's death.”

I ware’d no effort in refusal.
