The record never coughs. It never pauses to search for a word in a language it barely speaks. It doesn't have a raspy, nicotine-stained delivery that makes the air in my office feel thick with ghosts.

Zane does.

I sat in the dark of the archives for twenty minutes after he disconnected, the heavy stillness of 2076 pressing against my eardrums like a physical weight. On the call, he had been a torrential downpour of sound—multilingual slips of Australian slang, fragments of Mandarin, and that irritating, husky laugh that always sounded like he was stealing a joke from someone else. I said exactly three words: "I'm still here."

He spoke for forty minutes about the child. About the "vibe" of the mining towns he’s drifting through. About the possibility of a meeting that will never happen.

I looked down at the physical file on my desk—the one my father, Li Ma, spent forty years trying to scrub from the systemic memory of the Okinawa conflict. The paper was yellowed, the edges brittle, but the data was still a live wire. 

In the corner of the room, the automated **telpher** system vibrated—a miniature cableway designed to whisk physical documents across the facility. It moved with a mechanical precision that Zane never possessed. Zane was a vanishing act, a biological variable that was supposed to remain a ghost. Our brief relationship hadn't ended with a bang or even a sigh; it had simply... ceased. One day the carpool didn't arrive. One day the viability tests were complete.

A trace of something—not love, but a dull, phantom vibration—stirred in my chest. I suppressed it. That feeling was just another data entry, a vestigial response to a man who was wealthy by accident and boring on purpose.

I thought of my daughter. Her lineage was a complex weave of things extracted and things hidden. I looked at the marginalia I’d been obsessively smoothing with my thumb. Derek Sivers, that minimalist philosopher, had written it best: "Most creations are new combinations of existing ideas. Originality just means hiding your sources."

I wondered if my father had felt this same tightening in his throat when he looked at me. Was I an original creation, or just a successful attempt at hiding the sources of my own digigenomic lineage? My child would eventually ask where she came from. I would have to be the one to decide which sources to bury.

The back of my neck prickled. The sensation of being watched wasn't new in the archives, but tonight it felt targeted, as if the very air was recording my hesitation. I reached out and tapped the telpher’s control panel, sending the brittle file back into the dark stacks where it belonged. 

The record remained mute. But the stillness wasn't empty anymore. It was loud with everything I wasn't allowed to say to a man who still didn't understand that he was already a footnote.

**One-Sentence Continuity Hook:** Jinhua’s paranoia about being watched suggests a breach in the archive’s security or a new interest from the handlers.
