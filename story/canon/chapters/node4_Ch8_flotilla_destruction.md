## CHAPTER TEXT

**SHADE'S JOURNAL — YONAGUNI, NODE 4**  
**ENTRY:** [TIMESTAMP CORRUPTED]  
**MENTAL STATE:** TERMINAL

---

My liver is the first organ to know something is wrong.

Not my brain. Not my heart. The liver—the organ that filters toxins, that processes bile, that takes the poison and makes it survivable. It spasms before I understand what I'm seeing. Because when horror is too large for cognition, the body knows before the mind can catch up.

Sun is rising.

Not metaphor. He's lifting off the Monument's crown, his silhouette bent against the gray morning like a figure cut from negative space. His arms are at his sides, which means he's pulling from us—from me and Lock—without asking.

I can feel it. The Dare-link burns behind my eyeballs, a migraine that tastes of copper and ozone.

---

The flotilla stretches across the horizon.

American destroyers. PLAN frigates. They've formed a crescent; their coordination is terrifying, because these two navies have been trading fire for months, yet here they stand united, weapons trained not on each other but on an island the size of a township, because they're more afraid of us than they are of each other.

I should feel proud. I don't.

Because my brother—my eldest brother, the one who taught me how to tie fishing knots and read star charts—is ascending toward them with the physicality of a comet, and the heat spilling off him is so intense that the air itself is contracting, which causes the temperature on the beach to plummet even as the sky goes white, which makes me understand, for the first time since this war started, that there might be no coming back from this.

---

**[THE FIRST STRIKE]**

The flagship goes first.

It's an American destroyer—Arleigh Burke-class, the kind I studied in war college—and I watch Sun's light carve through its hull like a surgeon's blade parting tissue. The steel doesn't resist. It separates. The ship's midsection drops into the sea while the bow and stern rise in opposite directions, two headstones tipping toward each other before the water swallows both.

No explosion. Too fast for that.

Just a bisection so clean that my liver cramps again, forcing bile up into my throat.

---

**[THE SECOND STRIKE]**

He hits two PLAN frigates simultaneously.

The beams fork—I didn't know he could do that—and the ships become physiokinetic expressions of their own destruction, their superstructures folding inward as if genuflecting before the god who unmakes them. Men are visible now: specks against the fire, some jumping, some already falling. I can't hear them. The distance is too great. But I know what a falling man looks like from a hundred meters, and I know what it looks like from three kilometers, and both images are burned into the same place behind my eyes now.

Lock is shouting something. I can't process it.

All I can see is Sun.

---

**[THE THIRD STRIKE]**

Three more.

He's not slowing.

A PLAN cruiser tries to turn, engines throwing up a wall of foam, but the beam catches its stern and the propulsion system vanishes in a geyser of steam and shrapnel. An American frigate fires a missile—Tomahawk, maybe—and Sun doesn't even move. The missile enters his light-field and detonates prematurely, the explosion absorbed into something I can't name.

He's walking on air. Stepping from one kill to the next like he's pacing a room.

And the bile is rising again, because my body is processing what my brain refuses to accept: that this is my brother, that I helped make this, that every Dare we shared fed into the engine now reducing a combined fleet to scrap and corpses.

---

**[STILLNESS]**

He lands on the water.

Stands there. Boots on the surface like it's solid ground.

The flotilla—what remains—is retreating. Smoke pours from half a dozen wrecks. Oil spreads in iridescent sheets. Somewhere, ammunition is cooking off in slow, irregular bursts.

Sun turns toward the island.

Toward me.

And I think: *If he comes for Zima—if he comes for Lock—what will I do?*

The answer arrives before I want it.

I think: *I might have to kill him.*

Not want to. *Have to.*

Because a liver can only filter so much before the poison becomes the blood, before the thing that was supposed to protect you becomes the thing that kills you, and I am looking at a man I love who has become something that cannot be allowed to continue.

---

The journal entry ends here.

I don't know what happens next.

But I know the shape of it.

**CONTINUITY HOOK:**  
Shade must now reckon with the possibility that stopping Sun may require an act he cannot undo—and that Scorch may not survive the fallout.
