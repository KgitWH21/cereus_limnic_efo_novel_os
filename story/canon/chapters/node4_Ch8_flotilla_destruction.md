We had no idea we were about to witness a heinous war crime. A moment that makes you complicit for merely watching, no matter when or how it happens.

Liver delivers a quiver in my gut. I swear I felt it. The surging acidic bile, smelling of soggy trash bag in the heat, squirting to where it didn't belong. When Sun rose in the air that was the sensation.

Scorch hit a knee in the sand. I doubled over holding my side in nut-kick pain. Both of us squealed like feathered biddies, producing oversized eggs as he drew on the Janus gene within us. 

Sky darkened beneath sunset as he lifted off the Monument’s crown. For a second, he was a silhouette cut out against the backdrop— a figure of negative space. 

I felt it. A triple Dare-link strained to near breaking. No damns given for maximum exposure for what he was about to do.

The flotilla stretched across the horizon. They blared horns, flashed lights, and waved flags of warning.

All useless gestures.

American destroyers. PLAN frigates. They'd formed a formerly horrific crescent, at least to a smaller vessel. But they weren't prepared for the power of a single mission-obsessed man.

“What does it mean to run, fly, or take a horse and buggy to your destination?”

He'd asked me that once, my elder brother.

I didn't know what it meant. He gave an explanation that went over my head, but said it had something to do with how you transmitted ideas. The method of movement describes the style of transfer.

What of flight then?

In my view it disrespects the receiver. A shout in the library, I think, because you force yourself into view of others, invading normally undisrupted air.

I thought of that as I watched him five with comet physicality at the cluster of floating targets.

**[THE FIRST STRIKE]**

The flagship went first.

It's an American destroyer— Arleigh Burke-class, the kind I studied in war college— and I watch Sun's light carve through its hull like a surgeon's blade parting tissue. 

The steel separated. Two halves of hull dropped into the sea while the bow and stern rose in opposite directions, two headstones tipping toward each other before the water swallowed both.

I could only imagine Pearl Harbor chaos aboard. 

The bisection was so clean that my liver cramped again. Bile watered my throat.

**[THE SECOND STRIKE]**

He hit two PLAN frigates simultaneously. At least that's how it seemed. I saw the blast before I smelled the smoky air.

The beams forked and the ships menjadi (became) physiokinetic expressions of their own destruction; their superstructures crunched inward in humbled genuflection before this higher being reinstating a new era of peonagentic suffering not seen in centuries. 

Sailors sailed from the sides of the ship to chance a potentially bone-shattering dive. The lucky ones weren't burning. 

Lock shouted something. I can't remember what it was.

All I remember is fire blending with the colors of dusk.

**[THE THIRD STRIKE]**

One ship managed to get a missile off.

An American frigate fired a Tomahawk, maybe— but Sun evaded it then streaked down to exact revenge on the bridge. Through binoculars, I only saw red on the windows when he was done. 

Part of me didn’t want to accept the brutality. That he had lost so much faith in humanity and transformed into neutral force of nature to rain over them all while soaked in cynicism? Lock had a point, was it all cuz of us?

Every Dare, while providing immeasurable power, drained us of the ability for eventual re-integration. For the first time, I thought I might have to confront, even kill my brother.

To let him continue that conciliar destruction is impossible. We have to make this right.

Without words, following his rampage, he returned to the top of the Monument as he viewed scraps and corpses leaving daylight for the last time.

Scorch was already strides ahead rushing up to meet him head on.
