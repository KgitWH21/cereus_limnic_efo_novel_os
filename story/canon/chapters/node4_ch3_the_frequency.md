# **CHAPTER 3: THE FREQUENCY**

The path to the marina was paved with dead birds.
Sparrows. Crows. A heron twisted like a pretzel. They littered the asphalt. No blood. Just dead. Dropped from the sky mid-flight.
"Cadence," I whispered. "He's turning up the volume."
Shade didn't answer. He stepped over a crow. He kept moving.
The air hummed. A low vibration. It rattled my teeth. It tickled the rot in my chest. Thrummm-hummm. It wasn't just a sound. It was a pressure. Like being at the bottom of a pool.
"Where did they come from?" I asked. "The birds. They're not local."
"Migration," Shade said. "Caught in the net."
"Or they were watching," I said. "And he didn't like what they saw."
I shivered. Not from cold. From the feeling of eyes on my back.
We reached the edge of the marina. The smell hit us. Sushi bar dumpster fire. Diesel. Dead fish. Me.
The marina was a graveyard. Rusted hulks sat in the mud. Skeletons of industry. The tide was out. Black mud. It sucked at our boots like a needy ex.
We needed a boat. A real one. Not a ferry or another trap.
"That one," Shade pointed.
A trawler. Listing to port. Hull scarred. Name painted over. But the radar array was new. Shiny.
"It has power," I said. "I can hear the hum."
"Can you pilot it?"
"Yes."
I lied. I hadn't piloted a trawler in years. But hey. Fake it 'til you make it. Or sink.
We moved. Shadows in the shadows. The mud was slick. I put my foot down and the ground wasn't where I expected it. My boot slid sideways, knee buckling, and then Shade's hand was on my elbow—hard, steadying.
Too steady. His grip held a half-second longer than necessary.
I felt the warmth of his palm through my jacket sleeve. Felt his thumb pressed against the inside of my elbow where the black veins branched like tree roots. He had to feel them too. The corruption mapping itself under my skin.
"You okay?" he asked. Voice flat. Professional.
But he didn't let go.
I looked up. His face was careful. Neutral. The Glassigs made it impossible to read his eyes, but I could see the tension in his jaw. That micro-expression people get when they're trying not to react to something.
He knows how bad it is.
"Peachy," I said.
His grip tightened. Just for a second. Then he released me and turned back toward the trawler.
I wanted to say something. Make a joke. Deflect. But my chest was doing that thing again—that pressure-squeeze that meant the rot was laughing at me. Mocking the performance.
You let him touch you. You let him feel how weak you are.
Shut up.
He's cataloging it. Filing it away. Middle brother. Observant. He's already wondering what you'll cost him.
"Patrol," Shade said. "Down."
We froze behind a shipping container.

Two guards walked the pier. One American. One Chinese. Walking close. Smoking. The smoke drifted over the water. Tobacco and cloves. Bad cologne.
Shade pressed his back against the container. Gestured for me to do the same.
I did. Put my spine against the rusted metal. Tried to control my breathing.
Failed.
It came in shallow gasps. Too fast. Too loud. The rot in my lungs was staging a performance, and I was the unwilling audience.
Shade's head turned. Just slightly. Not looking at me directly, but tracking me in his peripheral vision. Assessing.
The guards' boots crunched closer on the gravel. Maybe twenty meters out.
My chest heaved. I clamped a hand over my mouth, tried to muffle it.
The guards stopped. One of them said something I couldn't hear.
Shade moved. Fast and silent. He stepped into my space—no warning, no permission—and pressed his palm flat against my mouth. His other hand went to the back of my head, holding me still.
We locked eyes.
The Glassigs gave his face an alien quality. Reflective lenses where eyes should be. But I could feel his breath on my forehead. Could smell gun oil and sweat and something else. Something warm underneath.
His hand was rough. Callused. Covered my nose and mouth completely.
I couldn't breathe.
No. Wrong. I shouldn't breathe. Not with his hand there. But he was leaving just enough space. A gap between his palm and my lips. Enough for shallow inhales through my nose if I stayed quiet.
He was giving me air while stealing my voice.
This is what control looks like, I thought. This is what it feels like to be kept alive by someone else's calculation.
The rot pulsed. Liked this. Liked the intimacy-as-threat. Liked the way his thumb pressed against my cheekbone. Liked the heat.
I hated that I noticed the heat.
The American guard's voice drifted closer: "—count is wrong. Official report says two hundred. I saw the bodies. It was two thousand."
Shade's hand stayed pressed against my mouth. His gaze never left mine.
The Chinese soldier responded. I couldn't make out the words. Something in Mandarin.
Then the American again, clearer now: "Slaughter implies chaos. This wasn't chaos. It was... tidy. They moved in formation. Through the civilians. Like they were sweeping a floor."
My pulse hammered. Shade had to feel it through my skin. Had to feel the way my heart was trying to break my ribs.
Sun. They're talking about Sun.
"Stabbing unit," the Chinese soldier said. English thick. "You see the wounds? Five punctures. Perfect spacing. No human does that. No human has the stamina."
No human has the stamina.
The words landed like bullets.
That's what I needed. That stamina. That superhuman endurance. The Janus gene that let the brothers function at levels that would kill normal operatives. The genetic key that might—might—stop the rot from eating me alive.
And they were talking about Sun like he was a force of nature. Like he'd stopped being human and become something else.
What if the gene is corrupted? What if ascension means I'm too late?
"Sun," the American said. The name hung in the air. "They say he ascended. They say he's not human anymore."
Shade's jaw tightened. I felt it through his hand.
"If he can do that at one node," the Chinese soldier said, "what happens when he reaches a city?"
What happens when I try to extract from something like that?
The guards moved closer. Stopped maybe ten meters from our container. Close enough that I could hear one of them exhale smoke.
"Reminds me of Dili," the Chinese soldier said. "I read about it. Back in '91. The Santa Cruz massacre. But worse. At least there, they just shot them. Here? The officers walked through the bodies like burial inspectors. No fear. No rush. Just... checking."
Every thud of my heart rattled my skull. Thump. Thump. Thump. Too loud. They'd hear it. They'd hear the rot singing backup harmony.
Shade's hand shifted. His thumb moved—just slightly—tracing the edge of my jaw.
Not professional. Not tactical.
A question.
I met his eyes. Tried to communicate through the narrow space between terror and cooperation: I'm okay. I'm holding. Don't let go yet.
His expression didn't change. But his thumb stopped moving.
"Dili?" the American asked. "Where the hell is that?"
"Just north of Australia. Tiny country. Their government uses Facebook as their website. Saltwater crocodiles are sacred there."
"Really?"
"Yeah. The country's shaped like one."
The American spat. "Superstitious nonsense."
"Maybe. But the bodies were real. Just like Iheya."
Shade's hand tensed against my mouth.
Iheya. Where his mother died. Where Lock—
The guards turned. Walked back down the pier. Boots crunching on gravel.
Shade waited. Five seconds. Ten.
Then he dropped his hand.
I gasped. Couldn't help it. Sucked air like a drowning woman. The rot surged, flooding my lungs with that wet-heavy feeling, and I doubled over coughing.
Shade caught me again. Both hands on my shoulders this time. Holding me upright while I hacked into my fist.
"Timeera—"
"I'm fine." The words came out strangled. "I'm fine."
I wasn't fine.
When I looked up, there was blood on my hand. Not much. Just a smear. Dark and viscous.
Shade saw it.
I watched his face do the math. Registered the exact moment he understood that this wasn't manageable deterioration. This was accelerating failure.
"How long?" he asked.
"Long enough."
"That's not an answer."
"It's the only one you're getting."
I straightened. Forced myself to stand without his support. Wiped the blood on my pants where it wouldn't show.
"The trawler," I said. "Let's move."
He didn't argue. Just turned and headed toward the boat.
But I saw the way he positioned himself. Slightly ahead of me. Close enough to intercept if I fell. Far enough to pretend he wasn't watching.
He's decided I'm a tactical liability. He's already calculating the cost of keeping me alive versus cutting me loose.
The rot whispered agreement.

We climbed the ladder to the trawler. I went first. Had to. Couldn't let him see how much it cost me.
My hands shook on the rungs. The black veins stood out against my skin, pulsing with something that wasn't quite blood anymore. I made it three rungs up before my grip failed.
Shade caught me. One hand on my belt, the other braced against the hull. He didn't say anything. Just held me there until I found the next rung.
"Thanks," I muttered.
"Move."
We reached the deck. It was slick. Wet. Covered in something I didn't want to identify.
"Don't shoot!"
A voice. Small. Trembling.
We spun. Shade raised his weapon.
A man and a woman huddled by the wheelhouse. Locals. Old. Weather-beaten. They held fishing knives. Shaking.
"Please," the woman said. Her voice broke. "We just want to leave."
The man stepped in front of her. His knife hand trembled, but his eyes were steady. Brave. Stupid.
"It's our boat," he said. "You can't take it."
I looked at them. Really looked.
They were terrified. Not of us. Of something else. Something that made armed strangers feel like the safer option.
"We're not taking it," I said. Stepped forward. Put on my best 'trust me, I'm a professional' smile.
It felt brittle. My face didn't want to hold the expression. But I forced it anyway.
"We're commandeering it. And you're coming with us."
"With you?" The woman looked at Shade. At his weapon. Then at me.
Her gaze caught on my neck. The black veins crawling up toward my jaw.
Her expression shifted. Fear to revulsion to pity.
"You are... sick," she whispered.
The word landed heavier than it should have.
Sick. Dying. Rotting. Failed operative. Discarded asset.
"I'm delightful," I said. The joke fell flat. Even to me. "And I'm your only ticket out of here. Those soldiers? They're not letting anyone leave. You know that."
The man lowered his knife. He looked at the dead birds on the deck. He looked at the sky.
"The song," he whispered. "It's getting louder."
"Yeah," I said. "Something's warming up. Let's not be here when it goes off."
I held out my hand.
"Keys."
The man hesitated.
The woman touched his arm. Said something in rapid Okinawan. He glanced at her. Then at me.
Then he tossed the keys.
I caught them. Barely. My hand closed around cold metal and I forced myself not to drop them.
At least I could still catch.
"Start the engine," I told Shade. "I'll cast off."
He moved past me toward the wheelhouse. Paused. Turned back.
"You're not piloting."
"Excuse me?"
"You can barely stand. I'll pilot. You navigate."
It wasn't a question. Wasn't even a suggestion. Just a statement of tactical reality delivered with the emotional warmth of a field report.
He's right. You know he's right.
"Fine," I said.
He nodded. Headed for the wheelhouse.
I turned to the mooring lines. Started casting off. My hands shook. The knots were simple—basic seamanship—but my fingers wouldn't cooperate. The rope kept slipping.
The old woman moved closer. Didn't say anything. Just started helping with the lines. Her hands were steady. Competent.
"Thank you," I whispered.
She met my eyes. "You're dying," she said. Matter of fact. Not cruel. Just true.
"Yes."
"Why are you running? Why not rest?"
I laughed. It came out bitter. "Because if I stop, I'm dead. If I keep moving, I'm probably dead. But at least there's a chance."
She nodded. Like that made sense. Like she'd done the same math herself once.
"The island doesn't let go," she said. "Not easily."
"I've noticed."
The last line came free. The trawler drifted away from the pier.
The engine coughed. Sputtered. Then roared to life.
Shade emerged from the wheelhouse. "We're ready."
I looked at the water. The deep, dark water.
It was waiting. And it was hungry.
And somewhere, in the hum, in the dead birds, in the black veins spreading like cracks in glass... I felt them all watching: The Handler. Sun. God. Whoever.
They were all watching.
And I couldn't tell if they were rooting for me to make it—
—or taking bets on how far I'd get before I drowned.
