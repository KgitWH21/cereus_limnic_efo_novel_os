A sterile purgatory for dead facts, that's where I work. The dehumidifier is a comforting sound, artificial and dry, pulling moisture from the air to protect the paper. The room smells of old cellulose and ionized dust. 

On my desk, the dossier for Subject 734-C sits in a pool of fluorescent light. It is a thin folder, barely a centimeter thick, yet it contains enough atrocity to drown the island.

I align the edges of the folder with the corner of my desk. Perfect right angles. Order is the only defense against what lies inside. I open it.

The first photograph is not of a person. It is of a frequency analysis—a jagged red waveform spiking against a black grid. The caption reads: *Infrasonic Event 44-Alpha. Decibel range: 190+. Effect: Liquefaction.*

I turn the page to the casualty photos.

The contrast is immediate. The room around me is regulated, but my insides rage. The images in my hands are hot chaotic. They riot on my nerves as I endeavor to catalog, to solve, not judge. 

**Subject 734-C. Codename: Cadence.**

The report describes a woman who became evidence of a natural disaster in human skin.

Begin vocal annotation.

*“Subject demonstrates a preference for close-quarters engagement when sonic suppression fails,”* the report states. The font is standard military sans-serif, rude in clarity. 

I look at the attached field note, scrawled by a recon scout who clearly did not expect to survive the shift.

> *“She doesn’t stop. The sound hits you first—like a pressure wave in your gut—and if you’re still standing, she’s on you. It’s not fighting. It’s dismantling. She takes pieces.”*

I underline *dismantling*. A precise word for a messy act.

The dossier details her “manual interventions.” That's the term the intelligence analysts used. 

*Manual intervention.* 

Fixing a stalled engine is the machanical image my mind conjures, which doesn't do the pictures justice. The reality is her victims are earless, with ripped grooves of gashes in the surrounding tissue in the shape of human teeth.

There is a footnote regarding the specific nature of these injuries. It notes a recurring pattern in the trauma to the cranial region of confirmed kills. The tactical logic is **clear-cut**: by removing the external auditory canal, she symbolically—and brutally—negates the target’s ability to process her primary weapon, even though they are already dead.

Why do this? I thought about it for a long time. 

I look at the word I have just written in the margin. *Symbolically.*

No. That is an error. There is no symbolism here. That would imply art, or religion. This is function. This is a child who was turned into a speaker, trying to turn off the listeners.

I cross out *symbolically*. I write *systemically*.

The next section details the Capybara.

The dossier attempts to categorize them as "biological support assets." It lists their weight, swimming speed, radiation requirements. It reads like a livestock inventory.

I flip to the after-action report from the Naha seawall breach.

> *“They came out of the surf like drift logs. Slow. Heavy. Then they hit the line. It wasn’t an animal attack. It was a kinetic strike. 150 kilos of wet fur and muscle moving at forty miles per hour. They didn’t bite. They crushed knees and pulverized skulls of the fallen. They herded the perimeter guards into the kill zone like sheep dogs pushing a flock into a thresher.”*

The contrast creates a dissonance in my mind. A normally docile animal acting with the tactical discipline of a soldier. A soldier acting with the feral instinct of a predator. The archive feels too small. The dehumidifier sounds less like a machine and more like a breath.

I force myself to focus on the data.

Cadence. The Sonic Child. The Casualty Engine.

The file argues that she is an aberration. A failure of the conditioning protocols. A "rogue element."

I look at the timeline of her surgeries. The installation of the piezoelectric filaments. The removal of her ability to hear quiet. A mind of circling soundwaves crashing within her cranium. The introduction of the "Sorrow-Man" AI to monitor her stress by remixing the voices of her dead friends. It must have been daily delirium. What kind of monster did they make?

I set the pen down. It rolls slightly, disrupting the parallel alignment I established earlier. I do not correct it.

She is not an aberration. She's a solved equation they wrote.

It's not madness. It's cause and effect, the most rational thing in this entire file.

I stare at the last photo. A blurry image of Cadence standing on a ridge, the silhouette of a massive, rodent-like shape beside her. She is looking off of the ship toward Shade's vessel speeding westward, toward what they assumed would be escape.
