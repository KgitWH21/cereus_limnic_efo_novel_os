Ch 9. Scorch vs. Sun
By the time I arrived on the Monument it was too late to prevent the clash.

Scorch flared at his eldest brother with a flurry of hot punches. Sun dodged in flashes with the sea sloshing below, twilight light gave him a wicked shadow-movement.

“Stop!”

I bolted ahead to intervene, but both blasted me back; Scorch with a fire ring barrier, Sun with a pupil-white glare.

“Fuck!” This was their fight.

“Nigga I heard you wanted to kill me! We'll bring yo ass on and quit runnin’ with that pussy ass shit,” Scorch yelled up at Sun.

Sun floated down on heated air currents. Burnt oil, spent fuel and smoke rolled over battle space; evidence of his maritime rampage was in the wind.

“This is your final warning Scorch. You keep coming I WILL kill you.”

Scorch laughed hard and paced a little. “Y'know last week, I would've believed you. Part of me didn't want to. But after what you did to them ships? Back to those people on Iheya? What you did to… to Zima? I full well fuckin believe it. You insane man. Certified crazy. And I can't believe I'm sayin this, but I can't let you go on killing like this. I fuckin won't.” He quit moving and stared dead ass at him.

“Brother, you don't get it and you never have. They will never accept you. No flag or country will have us.”

“Who the hell is they?”

“The ones who manipulate this war. The ones who unleashed us on these islands. The was never any escape for us, I've known that for awhile. We were missiles. Shot out on a singular trajectory, never meant to return.”

“No, naw nigga that's you makin up shit.”

“It is the truth. If you don't believe it you're in denial and are an impediment to destiny.”

“Ugh! Why you gotta talk like a anime villain? Can you speak normally for once, please?”

During the squabble, I saw a murky large ink blot farting fast toward the pyramid. Was it a fish? A torpedo? Some other piece of unknown tech. Recalling it now I can be sure, but I am sure what happened next. I'll never forget it.

An earthquake level force struck the Monument and it began to return to the waves below Yonaguni’s waters.

After that, im a Megaman-Protoman moment, my brothers hurled themselves at one another with the speed of catastrophic impact.

A solar flare lashing out at the source of universal light was the last thing I remembered before I Dared to get between the two men who shared my blood, prepared to ruin this once isolated island for good.

In the corner of my eye back on the beach, I hallucinated Timeera standing with two local women as they ferried a small boat towards us.

My last memory of the cataclysm was feeling the heat of thermal apogee as I got between them.
