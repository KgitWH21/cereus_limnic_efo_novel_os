Shall we begin with sound? An earful effluence milking into the air toward that dripping fortress I raised. You know them well. The waters are roads well traveled for you. You were undetected. That's good, since we have time to Observe before we attend to O-D-A part. I'm very much seeing the forward to the confrontation ahead. A pause, perhaps a parting from this garage of music, that will be something. 

Do you hear it?

To the untrained ear, it was just the ocean. The rhythmic crash of water against the rising stone of the Monument. But to the listener, it was a chaotic, atonal scratching. Tectonic treble grinding to a tooth-yanking low C-sharp. That's the sound. Wind pulling through half-flooded limestone caves with the harsh sibilance of a string section of frayed cello bows. I hear them gather. 

And then, a new rhythm interludes.

*Stumble. Drag. Stumble. Drag.*

Two figures emerged from the beach as shipwrecked sailors do, breaking the visual continuity of dotted sand. At a high key they modulated into minor plagues. Pests of battle indeed. Won't you go Orient yourself to them? I arrive soon.

[NEW FEED]

The first, a man, moved with the heavy, uneven tempo of exhaustion. His breathing was a wet, ragged percussion. *In-hiss. Out-wheeze.* He supported the second figure, a woman who was barely a melody at all—just a fading signal, a radio station losing its transmission to the static of the void. In the splendor of your monument, they were all but on all fours.

Shade. And the much infirmed Timeera Koi.

They collapsed near the water’s edge. Sand muffled the their footprints with soft sucks.

From the grassy dunes further up the beach, two other signatures approached. These were stronger, louder. One was a steady, grounded beat—Zima. The other was a volatile, crackling distortion—Scorch.

The quartet was assembled. The orchestra tuned. I pricked up my ears and listened.

"Bro I knew you'd come. You look like shit," Scorch said. His voice was a snare drum, sharp and aggressive. The running surf could hardly compete.

Shade looked up. His face was a map of bruises, but his eyes were steady. "You look worse my nigga." They hugged hard for a short time. "That you?" He turned to the great rock of the monument.

"Naw. No idea what the hell it is, or why it raised up. Can't be good though." Scorch scratched his chin. "You know Sun comin'."

Shade nodded. "Yeah. I don't know how, or why he's doin' what he's doin' but something tells me he's comin'."

"Why?"

"To end the war. That's what he said."

"You sure it's not to kill me? You know dat nigga don't play. He mean what he say. Not a funny bone in that man's body."

The one they call Timeera dragged herself over while holding her side. A chill in the air made my nose twitch. Threatening rain looks down from the gloom.

"Look boys, I'm sorry to break this reunion up, but if you didn't notice a giant pyramid came out of the water and we're being chased by Cadence, so--"

"Who's that?" Scorch interrupted. He narrowed his eyes at the afflicted woman. Zima placed a light hand on his shoulder. Shade viewed her an ambiguous eyebrow raised.

"She's one of the C-Unit. Followed up from Kumejima, so she can't be far behind."

Not far at all. She's LISTENING always.

Scorch grabbed his brother's arm and pulled him into an attempted private exchange. The females didn't hear, but I could.

Scorch kept a **discreet** distance, from Timeera as if proximity might transmit disease. "Nigga you crazy?You brought her? After what she did?"

He pointed at Timeera. The woman was grey, her skin possessing the sheen of old sweat. She didn't look up. She was focused entirely on the labor of breathing . Zima rushed from the treeline with water some handmade vessel to help her drink.

"Dude don't be like this. She helped me get here," Shade said. He shifted, trying to shield her with his body. "Bro she's sick."

"What she got? Super COVID? TB? AIDS?"

Shade remained serious. "No, no it's some kinda degenerative mitochondrial thing. I don't really understand it. But whatever it is movin' fast. She might not have much time, so..."

"So what? Seems like karma to me."

"If there was karma both our Black asses would be long dead."

Scorch though a moment. He studied her, then went back to Shade. "Y'all fuckin' right? That why?"

"Scorch, nigga c'mon," Shade said with exasperation. But a smirked leaked out.

His brother mirrored his expression. "Naw, naw that's gotta be it. Because tell me why you tryin' to save some shady ass operative, Bond-girl wannabe who just tried to kill you?"

Shade turned and eyed Zima, really scrutinized her as if selecting fresh fruit at a market. "What about you and her?"

"What about her?" Scorch retorted.

"DO you even know who she is?" Shade crossed his arms. "I'll wait."

The younger brother stuttered. "W-well of course I know who she is. Her name is... is, hold up, start's with a "Z"."

"Ah hell Lock!"

"Zima! It's Zima! Don't look at me like that. She's got really nice, smiles and a big heart. You'll see."

"Mhmm And big somethings else."

When Zima came over with cat-quiet movement, the two men startled. "Scorch, I know your talk is important, but she's really sick. Her pulse is fast and weak. It's like watching a suffering animal."

Flames erupted from Scorch's fists. "She's A FUCKIN' SPY! Workin' for I-don't-give-a-fuck-who. spy, Zima. She's the reason Shade was tortured. She been followin', no stalkin', us, just to turn us in to her buddies at first chance. And who's to say when this Cadenca shows up she don't do it again!? Huh? Y'all fuckin' crazy to believe anything she say. Even CRAZIER to trust her."

Zima made a screwed-up face. "Scorch, my burning boy that washed up the beach, you're as bitter-sweet as cassareep."

Shade snickered. 

"I don't even know what the hell you're sayin'. But yo bro, why you here anyway?"

"Figured we'd get as far west as possible to get to Taiwan. But our boat barely made it here."

"Escape huh?"

"Yeah. And one other thing while you're here."

"What?"

"I need your DNA."

Scorch froze. The silence that followed was heavy, a suspended chord waiting for resolution. His incredulousness smelled of sea brine.

"Pardon?" Scorch turned back slowly. 

"Your DNA, just a sample of your blood.It's the only thing that can stabilize her."

Scorch looked and shook his head. "You want me to bleed for her? You want me to keep the thing alive that tried to kill us?"

"That was before. Now she's with us. She saved me from..."

"From what?" The chill factor around Scorch plummeted to zero. 

"From you. When you literally fuckin' blew up. Remember?"

"FUCK THAT!" He spit a barb of fire. "Bro! She's playing you, Shade!"

"She's dying!"

"Good!"

The shout hung in the air, vibrating.

Timeera coughed. It was a wet, thick sound. She rolled onto her side, clutching her chest. "He's right," she rasped. Her voice was barely audible, a scratch on vinyl. "Shade... leave it. He's right."

"Shut up," Shade snapped. He looked at Scorch. "Bro, I'm not asking for me. I'm asking for... I don't know. Mercy? For me." He produced a syringe from his cargo pocket.

Scorch stared at him. The fire in his chest—the literal heat he generated—seemed to flare. The air around him shimmered (no, *distorted*) with thermal waves.

"Mercy," Scorch repeated. He looked at Zima, then back to Shade. "You talk about mercy. Where was the mercy when they treated us like experiments? Where was the mercy when they sent us in this pit to die? Hmm!? Where!? You want me to save her? Give me one reason why I shouldn't burn you both right now and finish what they started."

"Because we're family," Shade said.

"We used to be. Now? I don't know what we are."

The dissonance was beautiful. It was a symphony of broken things grinding against each other. The resentment, the desperation, the hate—it all had a frequency. And it was a tumbled timber.  Real messy music. So loud they couldn't hear the other sound.

The sound of the water parting.

Far out, beyond the reef, a periscope broke the surface. Not a machine. A pair of eyes. Capybara eyes. Mine!

And on the cliff overlooking the beach, a figure sat cross-legged, adjusting the dials on a bulky, modified headset.

Cadence closed her eyes, letting the argument wash over her. She adjusted the gain on her receiver, isolating Scorch's heart rate (a rapid, thumping techno beat) and Shade's respiration (a slow, dying waltz).

"The acoustics here are terrible," she murmured.

Beside her, the giant capybara, chewed on a stalk of sugar cane. *Crunch. Crunch. Crunch.*

"I know," Cadence said to the rodent. "They're out of tune. All of them."

She opened her eyes. They glowed with a soft, red luminescence. She looked down at the beach, at the three brothers (well, two brothers and the woman who broke them) playing out their little tragedy.

"Sun is late," she noted, checking the horizon. The third movement was supposed to begin with his arrival. But the Command-Duo was lagging.

She stood up, brushing the limestone dust from her pants. She unslung the heavy, guitar-case-sized weapon from her back.

"I was told to wait," she said to the wind. "To let them gather. To let the family reunion happen before we dropped the curtain."

She looked at Scorch, burning with his righteous anger. She looked at Shade, drowning in his loyalty.

"But I hate this song," Cadence said. "It's repetitive. It needs a crescendo."

She racked the slide on her weapon. The metallic *clack-clack* was the crispest sound on the island.

"Remix time."
