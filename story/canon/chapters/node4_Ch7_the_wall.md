Again my phone buzzes. Third time in ten minutes.

I slam my hand over it without tearing my eyes away from the report. Whoever it is can wait. All interruptions must cease right now.

Only the footage matters.

**[0912 HOURS] — POST-ENGAGEMENT DEBRIEF**  
**SUBJECT:** AFTERMATH OF SUN'S ARRIVAL

The recording of police body cam quality: grainy grays blended with washed-out colors. Yet, when I lean in I can make out the details:

Sun stands atop the Monument. He hasn't moved. The waves around his position have stopped churning—crushed his planetary presence. His deanimation has left them all as wasted urea, useless by products of a superior machine, prepped for final expulsion. Nobody moved for a few seconds. My heart shook at the thought of the feed frozen. 

When motion resumed, I heard audio.

The damn phone buzzed again.

**ARCHIVIST NOTE:**

I have reviewed this segment four times now. When I watch the elder brother hold the younger in that sorrowful protective clench, the tears tug down. I can't help it. The burning in my eyes and chest is a malice inhaled. It takes over until I get up and pace around to calm down.

And then there's Zima.

Each time, I find myself stopping the playback at the same frame: Scorch's hands pressed against Zima's chest, his fingers blackening the fabric with residual heat. He's trying not to burn her. Trying so hard that the effort is visible in the tendons of his forearms.

And I ask myself—is this not the same man who burned an entire PLA platoon alive on Tokashiki? Is this not the same "volatile asset" flagged for termination in six separate C-Unit reports?

What does it mean when a weapon weeps?

Do we still call it a weapon?

Another phone buzz.

Mute.

**[0918 HOURS] — ARRIVAL OF LOCAL CONTACT**  
**SUBJECT:** CIVILIAN ASSET "HIGA" (FARMER, YONAGUNI ISLAND)

**TRANSCRIPT:**


Shade's helmet camera pans toward the treeline. A figure emerges—an old man with sun-creased skin and a gait that suggests decades of labor. He's pulling a wooden cart half-filled with enough carotene containing carrots to feed a dozen families on that tiny island. The brothers swang their rifles in his direction.

> **SCORCH:** Who da hell?
>
> **SHADE:** Lower your weapon. This guy's a local.
>
> **SCORCH:** The one she called. [Scorch's voice choked.]
>
> **HIGA:** [In broken English] You are the ones? Zima's friends?
>
> **SHADE:** Yes. We need transport. The western route—Taiwan.
>
> **HIGA:** [Long pause. He sets the cart down. His hands are shaking.] No. No west.
>
> **SCORCH:** Fuck you mean, no west? (Goddamn dis mufucka barely speak English, bro)

> **SHADE:** (Lock, I got this.) Yes. We need transport. The western route—Taiwan. 私たちをそこにつれていってもらえますか？
>
> **SCORCH:** Why you showin' off? It's Egipto all over again.
>
> **SHADE:** (Shut up)
>
> **HIGA:** [Shakes head, then points toward horizon.] Look.

**VISUAL LOG — 0919 HOURS:**

Shade turns toward the water.

The horizon is burgeoning with light.

Not by the distant sun,low and red. It's a line of cold white illumination stretching across the curve of the earth.

Ships.

Looks like a flotilla of 3 to 5 vessels.

"Unmistakable is the word that comes to mind, the shape of the hulls: angular prowls of American destroyers approaching. The equally sloped, aggressive hulls of PLAN frigates. They shouldn't be side by side but they are. United for the first time against one enemy.

---

**ARCHIVIST ANALYSIS:**

I have studied the declassified coordination logs. The 7th Fleet and the People's Liberation Army Navy—two forces that had been trading fire across the Taiwan Strait for months—agreed to a joint cordon around Yonaguni in less than four hours.

The official story is "containment of biological hazard."

But I know what they were really containing.

Word of the signal spike from the Cadence engagement reached as far as Guam. Every satellite in the region registered the same anomaly: a burst of energy consistent with a *Triple Dare* attempt.

This was no standard truce, however fragile. It was a shared sealing of a mutual menace.

And by the time the brothers realized this, escape was no longer an option.

---

**TRANSCRIPT (CONTINUED):**

> **SCORCH:** Bro this is bad.
>
> **SHADE:** How long have they been there?
>
> **HIGA:** Since morning. They came fast. Like they know.
>
> **SCORCH:** [Voice raw.] So what—we're just stuck here? That's it?
>
> **HIGA:** [Long pause.] Boats cannot pass. Even fishing boats. If try, they attack maybe.
>
> **SCORCH:** [Voice choked.] Fuck. And this is all cuza him.

He looked toward the top of the Monument. Sun was waiting.

---

The phone buzzes again.

I stare at it.

For a moment, I consider answering. Whoever it is really wants to talk. Yet now isn't the time.

The dead demand answers.

---

**ARCHIVIST OBSERVATION:**

What do you do when every door closes at once?

Is this not the question that haunts every refugee, every prisoner, every soldier cut off behind enemy lines? The realization that freedom was never geography—it was *permission*? And permission has been revoked.

I think of Shade, standing on that beach. Timeera dying in stages beside him. Scorch cradling a woman he'd known for less than a week. Sun, motionless on the Monument, a god with nowhere left to ascend.

What do you do when you realize the sky has walls?

**[0923 HOURS] — DEANIMATION**

The footage shows nothing for the next ninety seconds. Just stillness. The waves have stopped entirely now. Even the wind seems to be holding.

No one moves.

No one speaks.

The war hadn't just found them.

It had surrounded them.

---

**CONCLUSION:**

The stealth phase of the Yonaguni engagement ended at approximately 0920 hours on the date in question. From this point forward, every action taken by the Haven brothers and their associates would be conducted under global surveillance.

There would be no more running.

Only reckoning.
