Natural heat feels best, especially from a man you once thought cold. It was like standing close to an open レンジ pleasantly warm with a taste of something good steaming out. 

Scorch lay on his back in the bed, muscles shaped as smooth stones above the blanket. A stray cat hissed and scratch out back, the sky matched the clearness of the sea.

I rolled on top of him, skin on skin. His hardness had me again.

"Nice day. We should spend it here." I kissed him, but his lips stayed flat and dry. The ceiling was a target in his eyes.

"You okay?" I asked.

"Yeah."

"You don't want to again?"

"Naw, I do, I do."

I reached for his member. It wasn't everyday a man like this washed up on my beach. I needed to get my filling while I could. But that part of him was throbbing, while another was somewhere else. He was in two places at once. An impossible thing to be, only the wind could do that.

"There is something. You should tell me, Lock--"

"Don't call me that." 

While the heat coming from his piece withered, I could sense it rising as a summer sun from his chest. This wood house was a fire risk.

"I'm sorry Scorch. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Just talk. Act like I'm not here."

That got his attention. He turned his blaze-gaze on from neck to my scrunched breasts and back up.

"You really tryin' to be here, huh Zima?" He laughed a little. That made me happy like seeing a rainbow.

"Yeah! I can be like a chair. You can ignore me or even sit on me. As long as I'm the only chair in the room, I'm okay."

He gently slid me off with a hard grip. "You funny, girl."

Out of bed he went. He slipped on his military pants and went outside shirtless. So naturally, I put on outside clothes and followed him.

We had been here for days. Or maybe hours. Time had stopped being a line and started being a pool we were floating in.

I watched a tiny green speck navigate the stalk of a beach morning glory near my elbow. A pea aphid. It moved with a single mission, ignoring the giant woman breathing next to it, ignoring the man who burned with a fever that had nothing to do with sickness.

Last two nights had been an embered blur. Sparked by mutual holes we both had. I hadn't thought of my son in hours, but I still felt like my heart was still beating good. As for him, the battle left him as the ferry tracks the horizon. Now the ghost of the fight seemed to posses him again. He viewed the rippling crystal ocean as if it were a mirror.

"You ever see them do it?" Scorch asked. He didn't look at me. He was talking to the water.

"Do what?"

"Drop them." He sat up, sand falling from his shoulders. "The helicopters. They take people—civilians, kids, doesn't matter—and they just... let go."

"I think... why are you thinking that?"

"Becuase they just do it. Zero regard for life. It's all about the show. Like they goin' for style points--who can make the biggest blotch when they watch the red dots explode from above," he said, his voice flat. "Like fireworks. Like a game. To intimidate us. To show us that gravity doesn't give a shit."

He picked up a stone, threw it into the surf. No skillful skip. Only sinking

"My brother would have a quote for that," he muttered. "Something from one of his books. Wilde, maybe. 'We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.' Or maybe he'd say the gutter is where we belong."

The air baked around him. Crabs scattered away. Flies took cover. The sun ducked behind a cloud. I stepped forward and wrapped my arms around him. We could have been a foreign couple in a TV drama. The local island girl meets the handsome Black soldier in a war-beat island. I thought of the poster in my mind.

"You miss them, don't you? Your brothers."

Scorch laughed, a sharp, jagged sound. "Miss them? They left me, Zima. They fucking left me behind. That's what they do. Sun with his plans, Shade with his secrets. They always fuckin' leave. Can't trust the family."

I wanted to stop the tears, but I was too slow. "Yes. You can't trust them to stay as long as you want."

He turned and held me. "Wait-wait, Zima, don't cry. I didn't want to make you cry. What happened to bein' a chair, sheesh? Furniture don't cry."

I grabbed his arms and shook him. "If you'd sat on me back in the bed, we wouldn't be out here!"

He chuckled. "You right."

"Scorch..." My voice got softer than usual, the kind I used for stressed or dying horses. I know it was stupid to feel love so soon. To feel like I wanted him to take me away, that I could take the danger of his fire; face the firing squad or a plunge from a helicopter to see the man I knew he was, even if it meant I had to roast myself to do it. I wanted to tell him. 

"Hmm?"

Why didn't I?

"But for some fucked up reason, dat nigga, my brother won't stop, he don't know how to give up. Family's been fucked since Dad died, but for some insane cause he still comin'. I know he is, Shade. Sun comin' too. I feel it."

He **held his breath and my gaze**, waiting for me to contradict him.

I reached out and touched his arm. His skin was hot, dry. "I believe you. In this place, things just come when they come." *Like you.*

"You don't know him," Scorch whispered. "You don't know what we are."

The ground lurched.

Scorch held me hard. "What the hell?"

This was no earthquake. It was giant land spasm. Like the island was taking a deep breath and expanding.

The pea aphid fell from its leaf.

"What was that?" Scorch's fire balled in his palms with a protective boil.

I looked out at the water. The turquoise surface was churning, boiling white.

"The Monument," I said, the old stories flooding back to me. "It's not supposed to move."

"What isn't?"

"The temple."

"Zima, what are you--holy shit..."

The ocean split. A massive, dark shape tore through the surface, water cascading off its sides like rain off a roof. Stone. Ancient, cut stone. Angles that nature didn't make. Steps that led nowhere.

The Yonaguni Monument wasn't just an underwater ruin anymore.

It was rising.

It towered over us, blocking out the sun, a monolith of wet rock and forgotten history reclaiming its place in the air as if shoveled up by heaven. The sound of the waterfall hit us a second later—a roar that shook the bones in my chest.

Scorch stared at it with nothing to say.

"Well shit. That's not supposed to move right?"

I shook my head. It was like all thought emptied out except for us standing in the sand being looked down on by the alien temple that was supposed to be underwater.

"I guess we're not the only ones waking up."

I looked at the massive structure, dripping and imposing, and I felt sick. Scorch was the only support I had, so I clung to him.

"No," I said. "We're not."

And I knew, with the certainty of a mother who has already lost everything, that the peace was over. War found us.

Now came the real test of love.
