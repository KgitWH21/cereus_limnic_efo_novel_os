The ache wasn't physical. It was the memory of the chair in the Chrysalis black site—the way she’d ramped up the frequency until my eardrums bled, forcing me to choose between the noise and the needle. I chose the needle. I chose the suppressant that turned my veins black and shut down the parts of me that made me *more*. I didn't break then. But this... this running? It was doing what the torture couldn't.

I stopped, leaning my weight against a pillar that was encrusted with dead barnacles. The resort had been reclaimed by the sea years ago, before the water receded, leaving behind a skeletal architecture of rot. Through the shattered lobby windows, the island stretched out in a panorama of indifference.

Beneath the haze of the day, the ocean here was different than in Naha. It was a deeper, more violent blue—a cobalt bruise that went down forever. The wind whipped across the rolling sugarcane fields, flattening the crops in waves that looked like a green sea mirroring the blue one. Grass rustling with no man or animal in them was the constant sound. Below us, the small village of Eef sat abandoned, the roofs of the houses caved in like broken teeth.

It was beautiful. It was empty. It didn't care about war.

"You're stopping again," Timeera whispered.

She was ten meters ahead, moving through the shadows like a wraith. She didn't look back. She didn't have to. She could hear me thinking.

"I'm checking the perimeter," I lied. "We need to know if they followed us from the ferry."

"They didn't," she said. "If they had, we'd be dead. The search team at the dock was thorough. Too thorough. They weren't looking for stowaways. They were looking for *us*."

I grunted. She was right. We’d barely slipped off the cargo deck when the Kumejima port authority started tossing the hold. We were supposed to be halfway to Taiwan by now. Instead, we were stuck on another rock, looking for another boat, while the clock ticked down.

Timeera stopped. She turned slowly. In the gloom of the lobby, her face was a pale mask. She looked worse than me. Her skin had a gray, dusty quality, like old paper left in the sun. Her eyes were too big for her face, wide and wet, tracking me with a slow, deliberate lethargy.

"I can barely carry myself," she said.

*Liar,* I thought. *You're not just tired. You're rotting from the inside out. I can smell it. It smells like expired produce.*

"Then keep moving," I said aloud. "The Deep Sea facility is downstairs. Sub-basement. If the pumps are still offline, it'll be dry."

We moved past the reception desk. A skeleton in a floral shirt sat behind it, slumped over a guest registry that had turned to pulp. I ignored it. The dead were just scenery now.

I focused on the mission. Every step was a calculation. Iheya was burning—Scorch had made sure of that. We’d scrambled onto that ferry in the chaos, thinking we were clever. Thinking we could ride the panic all the way to Taipei. But the blockade was tighter than we thought.

*Why does it always feel mashed in the middle?* I thought. *The beginning of the war was clear. The end... maybe that will be clear too. But this part? This hiding in cargo holds and flooded hotels while my brothers rail at the world? This is just noise.*

I thought about Scorch. I thought about Sun. There seemed to be no way to bridge their perspectives. That was nothing new. Even when we were young, I only remember intense interactions between them. Sun and Scorch at the windows, me arms compressed in the middle seat-- bitch, that's what I remember.

Things only intensified as we got older. That 8 year age gap was a mawed rift. I felt I was at the bottom of it, shouting upwards to two sides who couldn't or wouldn't hear me.

"You still there?" Timeera asked.

"Of course."

"It's just you're more dull than usual today. Wanna talk about it?"

"Not with you."

"Look... I know you don't trust--"

For some reason I snapped, lost my shit. I spun and wrenched her arm. She yelped. I hadn't expected that.

"Of course I don't fuckin' trust you."

She said between breaths, "Well then why not just leave me huh? Why not just kill me here Shade?"

All I could do was return an intense glare.

"You won't, because you're not like them, your brothers. I see it in you."

"You don't know a damn thing about me. Or us."

"I knew enough to find you. To save you. Maybe even like you. But I know clearly that you have standards, even in the worst of times like this. You still want to believe. In them, this world, in me. Am I wrong?"

I released her with a shove. "We need to keep going. We can't be spotted."

I walked ahead, but I heard her say with husk, "That was some grip. Wish it was harder."

We reached the stairwell. It was dark, smelling of stagnant water and mold.

"Light," Timeera said.

She cracked a chemlight. The green glow washed over the concrete walls, revealing graffiti that had been scratched into the paint. *GOD IS HUNGRY.* *NO SHIPS.* *THE WATER LISTENS.*

"Cheery," I muttered.

"Watch your step."

We descended. The air grew colder, heavier. It pressed against my chest. I could feel the dampness seeping into my clothes, a phantom itch that I couldn't scratch.

The sub-basement was a cavern of pipes and tanks. This had been the Kumejima Deep Sea Water Research Center—a place where they pumped cold, nutrient-rich water from the bottom of the ocean to make expensive salt and cosmetics. Now, it was a tomb.

But it was dry.

"Clear," Timeera said, sweeping the room with her rifle. She checked the corners. She checked the vents. Professional. Efficient.

*And dying,* my mind whispered. *Look at her hands. Tremors. She's fighting to keep the gun steady.*

She lowered her weapon and slumped against a large filtration tank. She slid down until she hit the floor, exhaling a breath that rattled in her chest.

"We're safe," she said.

"For now." I limped to a workbench. I swept a pile of rusted tools onto the floor and sat on the edge. "Cadence is out there. He's not going to stop sweeping the island just because we found a hole."

"He can't hear us down here. Too much concrete."

"He doesn't need to hear us. He just needs to wait. We have no food, no water. We have..." I checked my watch. "Maybe six hours of daylight left. We need to find a boat. A real one this time. Not a ferry full of refugees and PLA checkpoints."

Timeera didn't answer. She was digging in her pack. She pulled out a bottle—a dark glass cylinder with a faded blue label.

*612.* Deep Sea Lager.

"Found it in the kitchen," she said. She popped the cap with the edge of her knife. It hissed. "It's warm. And probably skunky."

She took a long pull, her throat working. Then she held it out to me.

"Truce," she said.

I looked at the bottle. I looked at her.

"You tried to kill me in Naha," I said.

"C'mon. You're still butthurt about that? Imma need you to get over it. I was following orders after all."

"You shot my drone."

"I missed your head."

"Barely."

"Take the drink, Shade. Or keep moping. I don't care."

I took the bottle. The glass was slick with her sweat. I wiped the rim—a petty gesture, I knew, but I did it anyway—and drank.

It was awful. Flat, bitter, metallic. It tasted like the room smelled.

"Delicious," I said.

"It's calories."

We sat in silence for a long time. The only sound was the drip-drip-drip of condensation falling from the pipes.

"Why did you turn?" I asked. I didn't look at her. I looked at the phosphorescence growing in the corner of the room—a patch of glowing algae that pulsed with a faint, rhythmic light.

"I didn't turn," Timeera said. "I woke up."

"That's the line. That's what they all say. 'I saw the light. I saw the truth.' It's cult bullshit."

"It's not a cult when the God is real, Shade."

"Cadence isn't a God. He's a frequency. He's a weapon system that went rogue."

"Is he?" Timeera leaned her head back against the tank. The green light from the chemlight made her look like a corpse that hadn't realized it was dead yet. "Then explain the sickness."

I stiffened. "What sickness?"

"Don't play dumb. You see it. You smell it." She tapped her chest. "The rot. It started three weeks ago. After the first broadcast. I thought it was radiation. I thought it was a bio-agent. But it's not."

She unzipped her tactical vest. She pulled down the collar of her shirt. "See?"

"Those are nice," I said. The smile forced itself out.

She jiggled herself, "Yeah I knew you were a man of taste. But I wasn't talking about those. Further up."

I leaned forward.

"Oh shit."

Her collarbone was black. Not bruised—*black*. The veins were standing out like cords of obsidian, and the skin around them was translucent, revealing a dark, shifting fluid underneath. It wasn't blood. It was something else. Something alive.

"It resonates," she whispered. "When he sings... it moves. It hurts."

I stared. I felt a cold spike of fear in my gut. I checked my own skin. My dark hands were scarred, calloused, but clean. Timeera was spoiling.

"You're infected." I said.

She took the bottle back from me and drained it.

"I'm dying, Shade. I know that. I just want to die on my own terms. I don't want to turn into... whatever *that* is." She gestured to the algae. "I don't want to be part of the reef."

I looked at the phosphorescence again. It was beautiful, in a sick way. It didn't need the sun. It fed on the dark.

*She's a dead woman walking,* I thought. *She's a liability. I should put a bullet in her head right now. Save the oxygen.*

But I didn't reach for my gun. I reached for my pack. I pulled out a roll of compression tape.

"Give me your leg," I said.

Timeera blinked. She looked at me with those wide, wet eyes, tilting her head. She looked like a **loris** caught in a flashlight beam—slow, confused, and fragile. "What?"

"Your ankle. I saw you favoring it. If you can't walk, we can't get to the marina. You'll slow us down"

Timeera stared at me. A slow, crooked smile spread across her face. It was a ghastly expression, but it was human.

"You're not going to carry me, Key "Shade" Haven."

"No," I agreed. "I'm probably going to use you as a meat shield. But I need you mobile until then. Taiwan is a long swim."

She unlaced her boot, then slipped off her sock. Even with the smell of sweat-wet feet, seeing smoothness of her skin was a glimpse at one of the many things the war had taken from us. She flexed her toes.

"Are you just gonna stare at every part of my body you see, or are you gonna wrap my ankle?"

"I'm gonna wrap your ankle," I gripped it with care and got to work. She closed her eyes, and vocalized a sigh.

"What? Too rough?" I asked.

"No. Just that tough touch, makes me feel better."

Outside, the ocean roared, heavy and waiting.
