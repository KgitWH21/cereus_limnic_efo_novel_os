# Chapter 1: The Mountain Hideaway

Gray.
Cold.
The ceiling was a rough-cut patchwork of timber and packed earth. It looked like the underside of a shallow grave. Ishigaki mountain dirt. I could smell the dampness, the tectonic weight of the island pressing down on the safehouse. 

A high-frequency whine bored into my ear canal. I tried to swallow, but my throat was a desert. One eyelid was taped shut with dried salt. I focused the other one on the whine. 
It was the portable generator. A metal box in the corner, straining to keep the air cycling and the medical rack alive. 

"Don't," a voice said. 
The word came from the shadows. Shade. 
He was perched on a plastic crate, hunched forward like a gargoyle. He didn't look like a hero. He looked like a man who’d spent forty-eight hours dragging a corpse through the jungle and had finally run out of places to hide it.

"Where... are we?" The question felt like it was made of glass and broken teeth.
"Takatsuki perimeter. We’ve been underground for two days. You stopped breathing twice during the descent."
Two days. The Monument. The blue-white blast of Sun’s fury that had turned the Yonaguni pyramid into a negative image. I remember the water—black, freezing, and tasting of old batteries.

I looked at my arm. A plastic tube ran from an IV bag into my forearm. The liquid inside was a thick, sickly amber. It looked like distilled sunset.
"What am I eating, Key?"
"D-Graft," Shade said. He didn't look at me. He looked at the floor, his fingers tracing the rim of a combat vest. "Scorch's blood. I scraped enough off my gear to refine a sample before the cells turned. It's the only reason your organs haven't liquefied yet."
I looked at the tube. Scorch. The wildfire kid. He’d let himself be used as a surrogate liver while his world burned.

"And the pristine one?" I rasped. "The Golden Child? Didn't he have any holy water to spare?"
Shade’s jaw didn't just tighten; it seemed to lock. "Sun stayed on Miyako. He said the unit's DNA priority was for soldiers, not for... leaked assets. He's gone, Timeera. His beacon hit the Miyako node once before the blackout. He didn't look back. He didn't even ask if you were alive."

The Shattered Chain. I felt a laugh ripple in my chest, but it hit the fluid in my lungs and died in a wet cough.
"Typical," I said, my voice a dry scraping sound. "I didn't sign up to be the family's spare parts bin, Key. If I wanted to be a mother to you lot, I'd have kept the receipts."
Shade didn't move. He reached out to check the flow rate on the IV, his hand hovering an inch from my shoulder. He stopped. He knew the touch was a trigger. He knew it made me feel like I was being skinned alive.

"How did we get off the pyramid?" I asked, forcing him to move his hand back. "You didn't swim us to Ishigaki."
"The cultists," Shade said, his voice flat and clinical. "Those two women who survived Sun’s bloodbath on Iheya. They were still hanging around the shoreline when the Monument sank. They dragged us onto a fishing scow. They didn't ask for money or names—they just stared at the horizon like they were waiting for the sky to fall. We slipped through the first wave of the blockade before the US sensors could calibrate for low-profile wood."

He stood up, tapping a cracked tablet screen. Gray-scale feeds flickered. Shadows of ships. US and China, a cage of steel tightening around the main island. 
"Kadena is the target. They’re moving the tac-nukes into position. A 'clean sweep' of the remaining nodes. We're trapped in a dirt hole on a rock, and the clock is at zero."

He was crumbling. I could see the Peacemaker falling out of his face. He always wanted to keep things whole, but there were no pieces left to fit.
I looked at the amber liquid in the tube. It felt like a theft. My whole life was a series of stolen identities, and now I was stealing a kid’s blood to keep from evaporating.

"Key," I said.
He looked up. 
"I'm falling apart. This DNA... it’s foreign stuff. I can feel the graft fighting my marrow. I need a different kind of cohesion. Something that doesn't come out of a plastic bag."

I shifted on the mat. My skin screamed at the friction of the synthetic fabric. I reached out, my fingers trembling, and caught the edge of his sleeve.
"Timeera, you're not stable," he said. The Peacemaker was trying to find a rule to follow. He tried to pull away, his eyes wide, looking for an exit in the dirt walls. "You need the graft to settle. You need to rest."
"To hell with the graft," I snapped. I felt the nausea, the old recoil of the touch, but the biological demand was a roar. The world was ending, and I was fragmented. "I'm not asking for a medical opinion. I'm asking you to hold the knife before I drop it."

He froze. In the *sotto voce* thrum of the generator, the air in the safehouse felt metallic.
"We shouldn't," he muttered. "Not like this. Not while—"
"Shade." I pulled on his sleeve. It wasn't love. It was a grab for a life raft. "I'm shattered into a thousand pieces. If I'm going to burn when the nukes hit Kadena, I want to feel like a person for five minutes. Is that too much ambiguity for you to handle?"

He looked at my hand on his sleeve. His resistance didn't break; it just finally ran out of energy. He sighed, a long, hollow sound of surrender, and knelt on the mat. 
He didn't touch me yet. He waited. 
"You hate this," he whispered.
"I hate everything," I said. I leaned into him, my skin crawling, the touch aversion a live wire between us. "But I hate the silence more. Now shut up and hold me together."
He finally put his arms around me. He was warm, solid—a stability matrix I didn't deserve. As he pulled me in, the "Project" finally went quiet. Outside, the world was breaking, but here, in the dark, we were the only parts that still fit.

**Continuity Hook**: Timeera has successfully "grafted" herself to Shade emotionally and physically, ensuring her survival through his protection even as the nuclear threat looms at Kadena.
