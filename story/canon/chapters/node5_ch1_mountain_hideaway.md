Gray and freezing described the environment, but I had the first sense of warm stability I’d felt in a long time.

It was as if time had reconstructed itself back to the beginning of the war, with fancy corner quoins to reinforce the secure bricks.

“How did I?”

I remember staying on my back and giving myself a moment to scan my surroundings. This was an earthy place, made in a hurry, as if some previously occupying force worked to avoid fiery bombardment from above.

I could smell the dampness. Drink the mist of it. My first impression was it was mountain air: the kind that’s good for the skin and makes your heart pound harder, at first. 

Throat dry, very hungry, I sat up and saw him. “Morning, what’s a girl gotta do to get some water around here?”

Shade rubbed his eyes hard, set down his rifle, and brought a canteen over. There was a butt imprint in the soft dirt at the entrance that led out into the mist. We could have been kilometers high, I thought, but immediately dismissed it as stupid.
I drained the water in loud gulps.

"Don't drink so fast." He watched me while water ran down my chin. When I started hacking water out of my windpipe he whapped my back repeatedly. Did this man not know how to be gentle?

“Ah… uh..whew… thanks for the slaps.”

“Yeah.” He nodded and went back to what I assumed was his post.

While his position cemented again, I checked myself. No major injuries, still in the same bitter-sweat clothes I’d been wearing for days (I REALLY could’ve used a shower), but more importantly: there was clear thinking. And that was the sign the miserable pain, the kind that prevents you from focusing on anything else, was gone, at least for the time being. For the first time in days, I felt life again in all its promise and ugliness. I really needed to pee.

“Uh are there any… facilities for a girl to get fresh?” For some reason I got nervous asking him.

Shade pointed outside. “I have a few wipes left. You can have em’.” 

I stood. A little wobbly at first and my vision dimmed, but it held. “Sharing your last wipes? I feel incredibly special.”

He tossed the pack my way and I surprised myself when I caught it. I heard him exhale an utterance, but I couldn’t tell if it was a laugh or a “whatever”. In my antsy state, I decided not to think about it anymore, then I went out to freshen up as much as the field would allow.

When I returned, I was half a new woman with anxious pre-battle nerves rolling through me. I shoved my hands into my pockets to prevent them from giving the jitters away.

Shade was positioned at the entrance to the safehole, hunched forward like a gargoyle. He looked my way, then held his eyes there in anticipation of my question.

“Gee... well, where should I start?”

“What do you wanna know?”

“Where the hell we are? How’d I, you, me, us get here, what happened to your brothers, the island, the war; how and why do I not feel like everything hurts and feel, I feel… good.”

He raised up from his crouched position to come closer. About an arm’s length away, vision drilling through my skull, he said, “This is Ishigaki. Two ladies from the Chumi no Umi group ferried us out before the Monument went back under, Yonaguni is another battlefield now; Chinese sent an even larger naval force and took it in a few hours. Anything else?” His arms were flat at his sides, the rifle was pointed out of fighting angle, dangling lazily. His posture was of a man sentenced to a South African necklace: the tire was already oiled up and within view. Only thing left was the mechanic and the match.

I tried to remember not to let my impatience show, for the sake of his testicle sensitive male ego. Like talking to a grown dear that might buck and charge, lower your voice and the threat at the same time. “And?” 

“And what?”

“You completely skipped the part about your brothers.”

He turned away. There was a twitching in his hands first, then a neck roll, throat clear, a rupture in the mist but not enough to lift it. We couldn’t see beyond ten feet out there. Even with uniform, smeared with blood, mud of opponents natural, unnatural, and unnamed, I saw the first ripples of a happening so delicate and rare: like the rainbow it only happens in certain special conditions, a sparse shower, gloom with a side of glory, the cement-smoke clouds advance and retreat hazarding a return to storm. That’s what it was like seeing a man cry. Seeing him unburden himself of helpless fate, watching death over his shoulder, facing the floor, and having your hurt multiply with his. It’s a child at the height of an AK-47, out of place and cruel, and heartbreaking to watch. Have you ever seen that? There’s a brutality in bearing witness to it. And you just want to take it away, whatever it is that harmed him, do shameless violence to it, especially if you love him. Unless the source of his hurt is you. I thought that in the moment: what if it’s me? How do I take myself away? But if you’re sure, you don’t go away. You do what you can to wrap him in protective dignity with whatever you can find. Because if you leave him alone he just may do something, what men do: yank the problem out at the root, solve the issue, obsess himself to bodily breakdown to the answer, end the pain. So I used my renewed vitality to hold him hard and give him heat in that cold place. When he squeezed back making me gasp, I knew I’d done the right thing.

There was a stirring within me that, looking back, I knew he felt too.

When we let each other go, I brushed a finger under each his red eyes, to unequivocally display my being there for him, minus the tricks and the games I played before. He'd saved my life after all so I thought I owed him.

“Feel better?”

He nodded and gave a grunt of an acknowledgement.

“They have them?”

“Yeah… I tried to… but…”

“Shade we’ll find them. I'm sure they're alive.”

Shade returned a limp nod. I got close enough to smell the field on him. When youve been in the shit for so long it's as if your nostrils deaden to scents that would have caused you to gag in peaceful times. After awhile it's just part of the background like the vast ocean on any island. 

“It was you wasn't it? Who convinced Scorch to spare his DNA?”

“He's not a monster. Of all of us, he's the most caring. He wouldn't let something, someone who was important to me die.”

That thing air had me in a surly state. “Oh I'm sorry, I don't think I heard that. Let me recap. Did you, the genetically altered war machine Shade, just say I'm important to you?”

There were two huffs of half laughs that he let out.

“I'll take that as a yes.” I pulled myself into him and without even thinking further about it, we were chest to chest, no void between us.

At first he tensed, nearly broke contact.

“W-What are you doing?”

“I should be dead. We both might not see another beautiful island sunrise. I just, want to enjoy feeling like this at least one last time. Forget the war, the battles, and just be here with someone important to me.”

“I… see.”

The first kiss and everything until night fell, was the last time we connected so completely.





When I woke up the mouth of the hideaway showed darkness. Insects of the night carried on with buzzing and screeing. Shade lay beside me eyes on the dirt ceiling.

“This used to be an air raid shelter during World War II.”

After he said that, the temporary nature of the last few hours hit me. A biting breeze of mountain air rushed in. He rolled the blanket we were burritoed in tighter when I shivered involuntarily.

He explained everything to me.

The war had entered a new phase of potential destruction.

Both the U.S. and China had already made martyrs of their destroyed naval forces. Nuclear option was in play as a final solution to the Okinawa problem.

But nobody had known about the Japanese secret army. A wild card here. One that could change the entire conflict.

They were apparently engaged in liberation operations to expel hostile occupying forces from the Oki main island. Fighting of the most savage, body-mangling flame thrower variety, not seen since WW2 was ongoing.

“And your brothers?”

“After everything went down, they were captured by the last surviving member of the C-Unit.”

“Who's that?”

“Commander. Father of the C-Unit.”

In the dark, his body hardened. Though it was the first time I heard the name, I guessed there was an entrenched intensity around it. What he told me after that confirmed it.

“If anyone ever tried to rewrite us, or the story of the war, I'd kill them. No matter who it was.”

“I know you're not bluffing.”

We spent the rest of the night lying there in contacted warmth, but far away in our heads. Eventually I fell asleep. That's all I remember.
