## Lore
### The Rot / The Sickness
*   **Nature:** Not radiation or bio-agent. It "rewrites" carbon to make hosts compatible with the water/deep.
*   **Symptoms:** Blackening of veins/bones, translucent skin, resonance with "The Song".
*   **Origin:** Started ~3 weeks ago after the first broadcast.

### The Frequency / Cadence
*   **Shade's View:** A weapon system gone rogue.
*   **Timeera's View:** A "God" that is real.
*   **Effect:** Causes the infected to resonate and feel pain. Can kill birds mid-flight.
*   **Escalation:** The "hum" is increasing in volume/pressure.
*   **Behavior:** "Escort" mode. Followed the trawler to Yonaguni without attacking, matching speed.
*   **Dossier Review (2076):** Archivist Jinhua Ma notes her "manual intervention" tactic (biting off ears) and the "Capybara" unit as biological weapons.
