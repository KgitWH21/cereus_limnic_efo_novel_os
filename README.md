# **Cereus & Limnic: Escape From Okinawa: Narrative OS (v0.1)**

**Welcome to one the first public examples of a *Narrative Operating System*: a book creation process designed, structured, and deployed like software.**

This repository contains the modular story architecture behind ***Cereus & Limnic: Escape From Okinawa***, a near-future techno-espionage thriller set in Okinawa during escalating geopolitical tension.

Here, you won't find a conventional manuscript.

This is a **Narrative OS**:
a system of interconnected, AI-readable components that together generate, maintain, and evolve a complex story world.

---

## **What This Is**

A Narrative OS treats fiction as:

* structured data
* reusable modules
* interoperable assets
* stateful scenes
* character systems
* canonical rules
* buildable “distributions” (Type A, Type B)
* software-friendly story logic

Instead of one monolithic manuscript, the story world is broken into **components**, much like a game engine or software project.

This allows:

* interactive adaptations
* custom readers
* branching variants
* LLM-powered assistants
* world consistency checks
* version-controlled storytelling
* narrative apps and interfaces
* future multimedia extensions

This repo is not just fiction—it’s **infrastructure for fiction.**

## **Repository Structure**

```
src/                     # App layer (Anti-Gravity, experimental UI)
story/
  arcs/                  # Node- and arc-level macro story design
  canon/                 # World bible + character system + canonical chapters
    characters/          
    chapters/
  manuscripts/
    type-a/              # Linear, traditional “build”
    type-b/              # Alternative build with different POV flow
  protocols/             # Writing protocols, WOD systems, narrative constraints
```

Every folder is intentional.
Every file is a unit of narrative logic.
Every manuscript version is a “build.”

## **Why This Exists**

The purpose of this project is to explore a new paradigm:

> **What if a novel was a codebase?
> What if story assets were reusable modules?
> What if fiction could be read, analyzed, or generated by software as easily as text editors?**

Most books are written *despite* the tools.
This one is written **with** them.

This repo is a working experiment in:

* AI-assisted narrative engineering
* modular worldbuilding
* multi-format story distribution
* reproducible creative workflows
* future-friendly literary design

It is also the foundational architecture for upcoming interactive versions of *Escape From Okinawa* and other HAC Studios projects.

## **Status**

This is an active, evolving project.

* Large sections will continue to shift.
* Manuscripts may change or move.
* Characters and arcs may be refactored.

This is the nature of treating fiction as software:
**it lives, iterates, and improves.**

Note: Some large manuscript files may not preview on GitHub due to size limits.  
To view them, clone the repository or download the raw file.

## **A Note to Readers, Developers, and Researchers**

If you’re studying:

* AI-native storytelling
* narrative systems
* games & interactive fiction
* story engines
* authoring tools
* or the future of longform narratives

This repo is a live field test.

You are welcome to explore, fork, analyze, or build on the structural ideas.

## **Versioning**

The Narrative OS is versioned like software.

**Current release:** v0.1 — Initial directory architecture and canonical asset import
**Upcoming releases:**

* v0.2 — Scene schema standardization
* v0.3 — Character ontology mapping
* v0.4 — Interactive shell API
* v1.0 — Full public manuscript build
